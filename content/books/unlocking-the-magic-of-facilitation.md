"Meg and Sam have given us a gift; their book is smartly designed to invite new and seasoned facilitators to be intentional about having those tough group discussions. As an educator and facilitator, this book gives me a framework to understand my own facilitation style, and ways that I can continue to improve."

Have you ever been in a training and marveled at how quickly the time flew by? Genuinely enjoyed a meeting you were expecting to dread? Learned something powerful about a topic you thought wouldn't engage you? Experienced an intimate, vulnerable, transformative moment with a group of total strangers?

Then you've witnessed the magic of facilitation.

Like all magic tricks though they seem to defy reason when you're spectating for the first time once the secrets of facilitation are unveiled to you, you'll look back with a bland obviousness. Of course that's how it's done.

In this book, co-authors and social justice facilitators [Sam Killermann](https://samuelkillermann.com) and [Meg Bolger](https://megbolger.com) teach you how to perform the favorite tricks they keep up their sleeve. It's the learning they've accumulated from thousands of hours of facilitating, debriefing, challenging, and failing; it's the lessons from their mentors, channeled through their experience; it's the magician's secrets, revealed to the public, because it's about time folks have the privilege of looking behind the curtain of facilitation and thinking of course that's how it's done.
