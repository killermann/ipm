Defining LBGTQ+ is a helpful guide for getting a grasp on the terminology of gender and sexuality. It includes definitions for lots of terms, explainers for how to use them, and more!

Now, before you get too excited, it&#8217;s not really a book-book. Think of it more like an elaborately annotated glossary, or a dictionary with way too much context.

The deets:

  * **It&#8217;s short.** It weighs in at 37 pages and about 10,000 words. 
  * **It&#8217;s printer-friendly.** I formatted to look great on an 8.5&#8243; x 11&#8243; letter size (sorry to my A4 friends abroad &#8212; if enough of you ask, I&#8217;ll format it in A4 as well!)
  * **It&#8217;s uncopyrighted**. Like [everything else I make here][5], so you can modify it and use it in your educational endeavors.
  * **It&#8217;s a work in progress.** Just like my original post, I&#8217;ll update this continually with changes suggested by you, and to reflect the evolution of culture.
  * **It&#8217;s pay-what-you-want/can.** You can get it for free, or choose to pay (whatever amount you _can_ or _want to_ pay, even $0! I&#8217;m happy to provide this as my gift to you). I&#8217;m delivering this via [Gumroad][6] (instead of as a .PDF download here) to make it easier to update you when I improve it or fix tpyos.

There&#8217;s a big ol&#8217; backstory behind it that I might get into at some point, but right now I just want to keep it at that. 

This is a thing that a lot of you asked for, and you now you can have it. 

Share it with a friend, print a copy for your parent(s), or add it to a new employee orientation handbook. Do you. I&#8217;m here to help.
