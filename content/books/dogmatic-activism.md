I don't know what it'll be called. I don't know how long it will be, or exactly when it will be published (soon!). But I do know one thing: it's a gigantic leap.

I'm currently, actively, and _publicly_ (!) in the process of writing a new book about social justice, minus dogma -- or, more broadly, dogmatic activism. Every day I'm publishing a new entry on [my personal blog (samkillermann.com)](https://samkillermann.com). 

<div class="button-stack" style="margin: 2em auto; text-align: center;">
  <a class="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bit.ly/sjmdbook">Get chapters via email as they're published.</a>
</div>

So far I've published one essay about [how talking about social justice dogma has been anti-viral](https://www.samkillermann.com/talking-about-social-justice-dogma-is-anti-viral/), and one about [how we (over-) react to pushback within the social justice movement](https://www.samkillermann.com/reacting-to-social-justice-pushback/). 

I'll be publishing another there later today. And tomorrow. And so on until this book is done.

This work-in-progress (WIP) is a continuation of a lot of the writing I've been doing [about social justice dogma here](/tags/social-justice-dogma), the podcast, the conversations I've had with hundreds of you offline, and more recently [the course I launched last summer](/courses/social-justice-minus-dogma-course/).

I said this [on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/im-publicly-new-32867191) but I'll say it again here:

> The most common pushback I got to the course was that people wanted more answers, not just to be guided in open-ended questions or nudged to explore the topics themselves. Namely: they wanted a book, not a course.

So I'm writing a book! 

And I'm doing it publicly because I need the [wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd), and the checks and balances that come with it, to ensure the finished project is something worth reading. I'm also hoping to model something that I'm believing more every day we need in social justice spaces: room to make mistakes, and work through ideas in front of others. 

With that in mind, I built out commenting on my blog, and will be reading all the email replies to new chapters I send to your inboxes.

This book, like everything else I've been doing regarding SJD, feels important and scary and like something I'd really rather not write and wished someone else would do -- but in lieu of that, here I am.

I created [a special mailing list](https://bit.ly/sjmdbook) for people to follow along, but I wanted to let everyone here know that I won't be posting the chapters on It's Pronounced Metrosexual as I write them.

I might crosspost one or two, if they feel like good fits for IPM, but generally I try to only publish things here that self-contained and useful to you right now, not WIPs that might hopefully be useful later.

So if you want to follow along, you'll have to do so [on my personal blog](https://www.samkillermann.com/topics/sjmd-book/).

Please let me know what you think about this by using the [replies](http://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/reply#source=WIP%3a%20New%20Book%20About%20Dogmatic%20Activism) here, there, or by sending me a good ol' fashioned electronic mail. 

I'm looking forward to co-creating this thing with you, and seeing what we put together come February.
