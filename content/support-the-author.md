It&#8217;s Pronounced Metrosexual is written, doodled, coded, designed, and all-around created by [Sam Killermann][1] (that&#8217;s me!).

If you want to support me directly, in the creation of everything here and [everything else I make][2] (all those logos in the image above for a snapshot of my output), **you can become one of my bosses**:

<div style="margin: 2em auto; text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em;">
  <a class="button" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/killermann?utm_source=ipm&utm_medium=support_the_author&utm_campaign=new_experiment">Become My Boss</a> <a class="button" href="https://bemyboss.es&utm_medium=support_the_author&utm_campaign=new_experiment">Learn More</a>
</div>

Or, if you just **want to make a one-time contribution** or express your gratitude for a particular thing:

<div style="margin: 2em auto; text-align:center; max-width:720px;">
  <a class="button" href="https://cash.me/$Killermann">Cash.me/$Killermann</a>
  
  <p style="opacity:.6; margin:.2em auto 1em;">
    (debit card, no account, super easy, any dollar amount you choose)
  </p>
  
  <a class="button" href="https://ko-fi.com/killermann">Buy me a coffee</a> 
  
  <p style="opacity:.6; margin:.2em auto 1em;">
    (<a href="https://ko-fi.com/killermann">https://ko-fi.com/killermann</a> &#8212; accepts paypal or credit card, you can create an optional account)
  </p>
</div>

<p style="text-align:center">
  <em>Just be sure to leave a note! ðŸ™‚</em>
</p>

This direct ask is a new experiment for me in 2019, and something I&#8217;m not comfortable with (as a poor person with lots of shame and hackles around money), but something that is necessary if I want to continue doing the work.

Thank you for considering supporting me directly to create for global justice. It means a lot to me that you&#8217;re even on this page.

I&#8217;ll be updating you all on the site as things move forward!
