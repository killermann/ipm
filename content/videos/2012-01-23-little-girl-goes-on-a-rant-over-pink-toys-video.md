How awesome is this?!

So many of us have experienced the frustration of being told something isn't _for_ us -- something we wanted to wear, or play with, or be -- because of our gender. It's outrageous, and it's something that doesn't seem to be going away any time soon.

I talk a little bit about this in my [Gender TED Talk](/2013/05/my-ted-talk-understanding-the-complexities-of-gender/), doing my best to capture the inanity of the little boxes we smush everyone -- and ourselves -- into, in every facet of life. 

But Riley does a far better job expressing her outrage about gendered toys than I did in my post [10 Reasons LEGOs aren&#8217;t for girls][1].  

This little human is going places.
