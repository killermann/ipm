Let&#8217;s see if we can save you the time of awaiting a reply to an email from me. The vast majority of the emails I receive are listed and preemptively answered below, in a surprisingly short list. If you&#8217;re still not sure, or want to say something nice (always appreciated), [get in touch][1].

**1. &#8220;Can I use \_____ thing you made for **\_____ (e.g., &#8220;a presentation I&#8217;m giving&#8221;)?&#8221;****

Yes. You can use anything I&#8217;ve made here however you&#8217;d like. For serious. Check out [this announcement I made uncopyrighting everything I&#8217;ve published here][2], as well as [the about page][3] for more details if you&#8217;re still unsure.

**2. &#8220;Can I interview you for this \_____ (e.g., article, blog post, school paper) I&#8217;m writing?&#8221;**
  
**** 

Yes. If we can do this via email, that&#8217;s easiest for me. Send me the questions, give me an idea of how many words/question you&#8217;re looking for in my response (e.g., &#8220;One sentence, quotable answers&#8221; or &#8220;go nuts&#8221;), and tell me the deadline. If I don&#8217;t respond by the deadline, feel free to send me a reminder. It&#8217;s more likely that I missed it than I&#8217;m ignoring you, and I&#8217;ll be far more upset if I neglected you than I will be by being pestered (pestering is what email is for, isn&#8217;t it?).

If email won&#8217;t work, get in touch and I&#8217;ll do my best. [Get in touch][1] and include some days/times you&#8217;re free and your Skype/Google+ username (unless you work for a publication I&#8217;m familiar with, I won&#8217;t give out my phone number. Sorry. My goal is to go this entire year without having to change it). If it matters a lot to you that you talk to me, then it matters a lot to me. I&#8217;ll make it happen, just let me know.

**3. &#8220;When are you going to be near \_____ doing \_____ (e.g., a show, speaking event, book signing) next?&#8221; / &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you have a list of upcoming performances?&#8221;**

In the past, publicizing events I&#8217;m doing online beforehand has backfired. Some folks view what I do to be controversial (e.g., see #4), and in the worst manifestation of this a conference had to hire additional security during my keynote because of the death threats. Due to this, I don&#8217;t have an &#8220;upcoming events&#8221; tab on my site (like you&#8217;ll see with a lot of performers/speakers), but if I have an event that is open to the public I&#8217;ll do my best to advertise it on my <a href="http://facebook.com/metrosam" target="_blank">IPM Facebook Fanpage</a>.

And if seeing me in person (whether it&#8217;s doing my show, speaking, or just for a book signing/reading type thing) is a goal of yours, the best way to make that happen is to be part of putting it together. Contact me through <a title="Book the Show" href="/book/" target="_blank">the booking page</a> and we can get that conversation started.

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">4. &#8220;Did you know you&#8217;re going to burn in Hell for what you&#8217;re doing here?&#8221;</strong>

Yes, I&#8217;ve been made aware. But it&#8217;s helpful to receive the sometimes-hundred-times-a-day reminders. Also, it&#8217;s worth noting that you can [be Christian and still be okay with what I do here][4].
