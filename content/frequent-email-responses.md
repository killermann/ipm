Let's see if we can save you the time of awaiting a reply to an email from me. The vast majority of the emails I receive are listed and preemptively answered below, in a surprisingly short list. If you're still not sure, or want to say something nice (always appreciated), [get in touch][1].

**1. "Can I use _______ thing you made for _______ thing I'm making (e.g., a presentation)?"**

Yes. You can use anything I've made here however you'd like. For serious. Check out [this announcement I made uncopyrighting everything I've published here][2], as well as [the about page][3] for more details if you're still unsure.

**2. "Can I interview you for this _______ (e.g., article, blog post, school paper) I'm writing?"**

Yes, but I only do one of these per week, and it ends up being a random lottery of sorts, where there is no higher priority given to a NYT reporter than a middle school book report writer.

If we can do this via email, that's easiest for me. Send me the questions, give me an idea of how many words/question you're looking for in my response (e.g., "One sentence, quotable answers" or "go nuts"), and tell me the deadline. If I don't respond by the deadline, feel free to send me a reminder. It's more likely that I missed it than I'm ignoring you, and I'll be far more upset if I neglected you than I will be by being pestered (pestering is what email is for, isn't it?).

If email won't work, get in touch and I'll do my best. [Message me][1] and include some days/times you're free and your Skype/Google+ username (unless you work for a publication I'm familiar with, I won't give out my phone number. Sorry. My goal is to go this entire year without having to change it). If it matters a lot to you that you talk to me, then it matters to me. I'll try to make it happen, just let me know.

**3. "When are you going to be in ______ (i.e., some city or country) doing ______ (e.g., a show, speaking event, book signing) next?" / "Why don't you have a list of upcoming performances?"**

In the past, publicizing events I'm doing online beforehand has backfired. Some folks view what I do to be controversial (e.g., see #4), and in the worst manifestation of this a conferences have had to hire additional security during my keynotes because of the bomb /death threats (and then they have to follow me into the bathroom, and I prefer to pee alone, _yada yada yada_). Due to this, I don't have an "upcoming events" tab on my site (like you'll see with a lot of performers/speakers), but if I have an event that is open to the public I'll do my best to advertise it via my <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/landing_pages/402557?v=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mailing list</a>.

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">4. "Did you know you're going to burn in Hell for what you're doing here?"</strong>

Yes, I've been made aware. But it's helpful to receive the sometimes-hundred-times-a-day reminders. Also, it's worth noting that you can [be Christian and still be okay with what I do here][4].
