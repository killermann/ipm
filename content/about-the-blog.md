[It’s Pronounced Metrosexual][1] is a website created by [Sam Killermann](/about/about-sam-killermann) where millions of people learn about gender, sexuality, and social justice by reading and sharing articles, edugraphics, and other online resources. It&#8217;s free, [uncopyrighted][2], and meant for advocates of social justice who are looking to do some good in their world via education and equity. IPM started as a comedy show performed on college campuses in 2011 (where the site got its name), before evolving into the online resource that it is today.

In both arenas (the show and the online resource) the goal was always to take complex ideas and present them in a simple, easy-to-digest fashion &#8212; making the experience fun & enjoyable whenever possible. Nothing here is meant to be the end of someone&#8217;s learning about a particular issue relating to gender, sexuality, or social justice, but rather an accessible entry point into the idea.

Think of IPM as an invitation to take the first few steps down a sometimes-daunting, lifelong road of investigation and learning about how to make your world more welcoming, inclusive, and socially just.

## Navigating the Resources

**If you&#8217;re not sure where to start,** start with this post: [50+ Concrete Ways to Work Toward Social Justice Today][4]. Or you can browse the [start here](/tags/start-here) tag for other recommendations.

For your convenience, I&#8217;ve broken the articles into three areas of learning: [social justice][6], [sexuality][7], and [gender][8]; and there are five verticals to break up the different kinds of content: [articles](/articles), [edugraphics][9], [books](/books/), [videos](/videos/), and [courses](/courses/).

Most of what I write here is intentionally timeless (_evergreen_, as they might say), so a standard chronological news/blog format isn&#8217;t that helpful. &nbsp;

Peruse the categories at your leisure, and call back upon helpful articles when you&#8217;re looking for something to share with a troubled friend.

<!-- ### Finding Articles by Social Share Popularity

As you browse the site, you might notice little badges I doodled with the share counts.

These counts show how many people have shared that thing across all the different social networks.&nbsp;You can also browse posts by their popularity, and share a&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="/tag/seedling/" target="_blank">Seedling</a>&nbsp;to help it break through that 1,000 share barrier, or keep adding drops to the ocean of shares of a <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="/tag/greatest-of-all-time" target="_blank">G.O.A.T.</a>

Below you can see what the badgest look like (click for big), and what they mean.

</div>

<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="/tag/seedling/" target="_blank">Seedlings</a> are posts that are approaching (but not quite at) 1,000 social shares. <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="/tag/crowd-pleaser" target="_blank">Crowd-pleasers</a> have over 1K shares, and <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="/tag/sensation" target="_blank">Sensations</a>&nbsp;have almost 10K. <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="/tag/rising-star" target="_blank">Rising Stars</a> are posts with about 50,000 shares, while <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="/tag/bona-fide-hit" target="_blank">Bona Fide Hits</a> are nearing 100K. My <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="/tag/greatest-hits" target="_blank">Greatest Hits</a> have over 100,000 shares, and my <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="/tag/greatest-of-all-time" target="_blank">Greatest of All Time</a> are the very few posts who have HALF A MILLION SOCIAL SHARES WUT. -->

### Three-Quarters Serious, 1/2 Not

The vast majority of what I do here is serious stuff. &nbsp;In the grandest of pictures, I write about oppression and provide resources to help advocates of social justice make positive change. &nbsp;Occasionally a less serious, more fun article will crop up. &nbsp;In both realms, I employ a bit of wry humor. &nbsp;I hope that&#8217;s okay.

### <del>Share/Borrow/Steal</del> [Uncopyrighted][2]

Or as my dad says every time he steals a french fry, &#8220;You know what I learned in kindergarten? &nbsp;Sharing.&#8221; &nbsp;I write all of my articles with sharing in mind. &nbsp;I hope to provide useful, enjoyable resources on the themes I cover, that will lend themselves to a variety of uses in the future. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t hesitate to borrow a snippet of text, or even an entire post. &nbsp;And certainly feel encouraged to print and hang and share the [graphics][9] I create. &nbsp;I&#8217;m writing and creating these things for _you_, so run with them.

If you link back, great. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll appreciate you. &nbsp;If you have a good reason not to, but still want to use my content, that&#8217;s fine, too (but I encourage you to provide some sort of context for your readers, because the nature of how&nbsp;I do what I do here is&#8230; well, _different_). &nbsp;For me, it&#8217;s the message that counts, not who it comes from.
<!-- 
<del><strong>The big exception</strong>: it is not okay, unless <a title="Contact" href="/contact/">previously discussed</a>, to use my work for commercial purposes. &nbsp;I work countless hours with no pay to provide these resources for free, and I&#8217;ll expect the same of anyone who uses them. &nbsp;For example, please don&#8217;t print the graphics I&#8217;ve created and sell them without permission, and don&#8217;t include something I&#8217;ve created in book (ebook or otherwise) that you&#8217;re publishing for sale. &nbsp;Ask me about licensing first, pretty double super please.</del> -->

When I first started this site, I was concerned about my work being used for commercial reasons, but my thinking has evolved a lot along these lines. Now, all the work that I&#8217;ve created on this site is [uncopyrighted](/uncopyright/), a decision I made in 2013 you can [read about here][2]. It&#8217;s something that [I&#8217;m happy I did][11], and in short my goal in uncopyrighting is to create access and remove barriers, something I see as a core principle of social justice.

### 100% from Me to You

Everything [I][12] write here is coming from my slant. &nbsp;I know that should go without saying, but I want to say it nonetheless. &nbsp;Objectivity in writing truly doesn&#8217;t exist, particularly not in writing as heavily-loaded as what you&#8217;ll find here. &nbsp;So know that I&#8217;ll be coloring these subjects and issues with my personal hue. &nbsp;If that&#8217;s for you, great. &nbsp;If not, then I completely understand.

On the other hand, I&#8217;m do my best to research, speak with lots and lots of people about these things before I write, and will not be rattling off too many unsubstantiated claims. &nbsp;Whenever I refer to a statistic, I&#8217;ll be sure to provide you a reference. If it&#8217;s anecdotal, I mention that.&nbsp; Not to show you I&#8217;m telling the truth, but to allow you the opportunity to read whatever article, paper, or book I was reading. &nbsp;Odds are there&#8217;s a lot more of worth there than the stat I&#8217;m quoting.

Oh, and I love <a title="Wiki: Wikipedia" href="http://wikipedia.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>. Like, with-all-my-heart-head-over-heels love. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been a knowledge&nbsp;sponge&nbsp;since I was a kid. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve always wanted to know how everything works, and I love learning. &nbsp;Wikipedia is hands down the best place on the web to start learning about something. &nbsp;Many of my external links in my posts will be to relevant Wikipedia articles. &nbsp;If I&#8217;m linking to it, it will help you better understand whatever I&#8217;m talking about. &nbsp;If it&#8217;s already there, I probably won&#8217;t spend much time rewriting about it here.

### This should be a conversation, not a lecture

These topics are heavy. &nbsp;Most people avoid them because they don&#8217;t know how to talk about them, or they&#8217;re afraid of what might happen when they do. &nbsp;Well, let&#8217;s give it a shot. &nbsp;I&#8217;m using the <a title="Disqus Comments" href="http://disqus.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disqus</a> comment platform with fully open settings to make commenting on articles as accessible as possible, so don&#8217;t hesitate to provide your perspective. &nbsp;I want to learn from you.

As this site was getting off the ground, some of the best discussions and learning moments have taken place in the comments. &nbsp;I do my best to read them all and respond, and use them to [shape][13] and [guide][14] [articles][15]&nbsp;and [resources][16] I create.

If you&#8217;ve got something to say and you&#8217;re not comfortable sharing it in the open, you can also [contact me directly][17] and I&#8217;ll be happy to listen and respond. &nbsp;I&#8217;m always willing to field a question, hear a concern, or just help someone process a thought they just can&#8217;t quite get through. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch.
