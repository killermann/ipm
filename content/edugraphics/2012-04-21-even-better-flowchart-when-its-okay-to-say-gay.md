When I published my <a title="Flowchart: when it’s okay to say “that’s so gay”" href="/2012/04/flowchart-when-its-okay-to-say-thats-so-gay-prin/" target="_blank">original flowchart</a>, I said it was for the more analytical folks who are wondering if &#8220;gay&#8221; is the right word choice for them.  Well, this one is for the _most_ analytical folks, and also folks who enjoy data presented in cute and adorable ways.

Oh, and as usual, my readers are way smarter than I am, and I wanted to give a special thanks to <a title="Bob Black on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/writhemic" target="_blank">Bob Black</a> for his comments on the <a title="Flowchart: when it’s okay to say “that’s so gay”" href="/2012/04/flowchart-when-its-okay-to-say-thats-so-gay-prin/" target="_blank">original flowchart</a> that led me to create this far superior version.
