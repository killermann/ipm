Taking the lessons learned from [version 2][1], and applying them to sexuality in a more meaningful way, here&#8217;s my best renditionÂ ofÂ the genderbread person yet.

<address>
  Hey! Friend! I published a <a href="/2018/10/the-genderbread-person-v4/">version 4 of my Genderbread Person</a>! It&#8217;s at least 33.333% better than this one. (Tbh, I think it&#8217;s better in every way, and anything you like about 3.3 can easily be remixed into v4)Â <a href="/2018/10/the-genderbread-person-v4/">Check it out</a>.

<aside class="heyHeyLook wednesdayEmail"><p><span class="icon">ðŸ’Œ</span><strong>Most Wednesdays</strong></p><p>I publish new Social Justice, Gender, & Sexuality Resources.</p> <a class="button" title="Join my mailing list" href="http://bit.ly/2MmE28c" target="_blank"> Get the Email. </a> </aside> 

Someone pointed out that I hadn&#8217;t shared this here yet, even though it&#8217;s been _outÂ _for awhile.Â I am in disbeliefÂ about how long it&#8217;s taken me to get this up on the site. I really don&#8217;t know what happened &#8212; time flies? I created the first iteration ofÂ my version 3 of the genderbread person when I published [my book][2]Â back in 2013.

I&#8217;ve posted it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetroSam/photos/pb.216393541757516.-2207520000.1426470128./684315374965328/?type=3&theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Facebook</a>, it&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetroSam/photos/pb.216393541757516.-2207520000.1426470128./712448095485389/?type=3&theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">translated</a> a few times, it&#8217;s even been <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetroSam/photos/pb.216393541757516.-2207520000.1426470128./630536900343176/?type=3&theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santafied</a>,Â and don&#8217;t haveÂ much of an explanation to share forÂ why I&#8217;ve neglected to share it here.Â But&#8230; here it is! Sorry? Sorry.

## What&#8217;s new?

There are twoÂ big differences from v2 to the most recent v3: separating romantic & sexual attraction, and the labeling of the continua. I&#8217;m also sharing it here with a more simplified version that I encourage folks to use for Powerpoints or to supplement any articles they&#8217;re writing, where the additional verbiage isn&#8217;t necessary.

**Separating romantic and sexual attraction** is a more accurate way of describing some of the ways we all experience attraction (or don&#8217;t), and it&#8217;s also an effort to make the graphic more inclusive of asexual folks. Check out this great <a href="http://www.asexuality.org/wiki/index.php?title=Attraction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article on Asexuality.org about sexual and romantic attraction</a> if you&#8217;d like to read more.

**Labels have always been one of the toughest parts of of the genderbread person**, because in my versions I&#8217;m trying to simultaneously reinforce folks current understandings (or former, orÂ _problematic_) of gender, while expanding and building upon their understanding, enhancing it, and making it a more honest depiction of the ways we allÂ _actually_ experience gender. Using the language that reinforces problematic and limiting understandings of gender as a means to expand understanding feels a lot like using the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/291810-for-the-master-s-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-master-s-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">master&#8217;s tools to deconstruct the master&#8217;s house</a>, and in this version I&#8217;m trying to get away from as much language as possible.

Here&#8217;s a testament to that &#8220;less language is better&#8221; sentiment, a more Powerpoint-friendly version you&#8217;re welcome to use:

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2860 lazy-load" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/genderbread-person-3.png" alt="genderbread-person-3" width="1024" height="768" data-srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/genderbread-person-3.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/genderbread-person-3-300x225.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/genderbread-person-3-800x600.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />][3]

## What&#8217;s the same?

It&#8217;s still totally <a title="Announcement: Iâ€™m Uncopyrighting Everything Iâ€™ve Published Here" href="/2013/11/uncopyright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncopyrighted</a> and yours to use however you&#8217;d like. No need to ask for permission.

It&#8217;s still based on the deconstruction of gender into identity, expression, and sex, building on my <a title="The Genderbread Person v2.0" href="/2012/03/the-genderbread-person-v2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second</a> and <a title="The Genderbread Person" href="/2012/01/the-genderbread-person/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first</a> versions of the genderbread person, which are my spin on the model that&#8217;s been around for a couple decades, which was based on the work of feminists from the past century.

And it&#8217;s still, I hope, as adorable as ever.
