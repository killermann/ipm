  This sign has now officially <a title="How the Gender Neutral Bathroom Sign I Made is Being Manufactured and Donated to Colleges" href="/2014/07/how-the-gender-neutral-bathroom-sign-i-made-is-being-manufactured-and-donated-to-colleges/">become a thing</a>! Thanks for playing along
</address>

I wrote [this post][1] and made the included graphic yesterday in a moment of what I call _using humor for self-preservation_. I was frustrated with the gender neutral bathroom sign &#8220;debate&#8221; and reached my tipping point. But, as several people have pointed out, like Fenix in the comments of that post, maybe it&#8217;s not such a terrible idea:

> You joke, but I&#8217;ve read dozens of articles on this subject, and you are the first to propose that the sign on the door (uniformly identified as the primary problem with gender-neutral bathrooms) be a picture of what&#8217;s on the other side of the door.
  
> Like all problems, the answer is obvious only after someone like yourself comes up with it.
  
> Thank you

Someone else <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetroSam/posts/690824747647724" target="_blank">commented on Facebook</a> with a link to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/07/07/189523504/new-handicapped-sign-rolls-into-new-york-city" target="_blank">Sara Hendren&#8217;s reinvisioned &#8220;handicapped sign&#8221;</a> (thanks, Eric!). Two roads diverged in an interwebz wood, and I &#8212; I mashed them into this. Wanna play along?

**Print one of the signs below and attach it to any single-stall, individual bathroom you see in your community that is currently (and unnecessarily) gendered.** 

**Take a picture with your phone, and post it to the <a href="http://facebook.com/metrosam" target="_blank">IPM Facebook Wall</a>. Share a story. I&#8217;d love to read this, and create a collection of them.**

**If you&#8217;d like, add this link to the bottom of your sign (and we can track how many people read it): <a href="http://bit.ly/genderneutral" target="_blank">www.bit.ly/genderneutral</a>**

Oh, and share/like/tweet/comment below if you&#8217;re going to play along. Let me know what else you need from me.

## The Super-High-Resolution Gender Neutral Bathroom Sign

## Leave a comment below or on my Facebook Page and let me know how it goes!

I&#8217;m really looking forward to hearing back from y&#8217;all. Let&#8217;s see if we can shake up this issue, and help folks realize that a toilet is a toilet is a toilet is a place where we poop. Everyone poops. Everyone deserves to have a place to feel safe doing so.

**Help me take this discussion out of the internet and into your real-life world. Conversation leads to empathy. Empathy leads to progress.**

## Bonus! (made this for my bathroom, but figured I would share)

Finally, the sign in my personal favorite color, Nic Cage:
