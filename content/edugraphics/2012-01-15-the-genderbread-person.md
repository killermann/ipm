  Please <a title="The Genderbread Person v2.0" href="/2012/03/the-genderbread-person-v2-0/">check out the new-and-improved Genderbread Person v2.0.</a> Â It&#8217;s a heckuvalot better and just as free to share/print! I&#8217;m leaving this up for now for those who want it, but I&#8217;m no longer endorsing it as <em>the</em> effective model.

The Genderbread Person is an infographic that breaks down gender identity, gender expression, biological sex, and sexual orientation into an easy to understand visual.

It&#8217;s been around in some form for many years, and this is my whack at making an inclusive, adorable, easy to understand depiction. **Click below to download a printer-friendly copy for your own uses!**

It&#8217;s perfect for residence hall billboards, school hallways, campus kiosks, office walls, or to be used in diversity/social justice/sensitivity training. Leave a comment and let us know how you&#8217;re using it!
