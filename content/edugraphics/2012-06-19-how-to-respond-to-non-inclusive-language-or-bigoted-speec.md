<a title="Why your intentions don’t really matter, but outcomes do" href="/2012/04/why-your-intentions-dont-matter-victim-blaming-and-political-correctness/" target="_blank">Intentions don&#8217;t matter, outcomes do</a>.  However, I still think we need to do a much better job of being supportive of newcomers to the social justice &#8220;scene&#8221; who may be well-intended, but don&#8217;t quite know the ropes yet.  

Following is my picture guide (sorry, no <a title="Even better flowchart: when it’s okay to say “gay”" href="/2012/04/even-better-flowchart-when-its-okay-to-say-gay/" target="_blank">flowchart</a>) of how to properly handle such situations, without scaring off a potential ally.

<!--more-->Here&#8217;s the text (for folks who use screen readers):

### 1. DON&#8217;T eat their faces off (FYI: I was using this expression way before people were literally doing this)

If they seemed well-intentioned, or even if you&#8217;re not sure what their intent was, you&#8217;ll attract more bees with honey than you will by being a jerk.  You want more bees, don&#8217;t you?  Also, bees, here, mean social justice friends.

### 2. DO kindly point out their error

Explain that what they said or did wasn&#8217;t inclusive or good or friendly or correct or, as the social scientists would describe the behavior, &#8220;non-douchey.&#8221;  But do it kindly, or run the risk of coming off as a bit pro-douchey yourself.

### 3. DON&#8217;T make them feel like bad people

Focus on the behavior, not the person.  They aren&#8217;t bad people, unless they are squirting vinegar at bees.  Then they might be bad people.  Unless bees are secretly into that sort of thing, in which case, go you.

### 4. DO provide a correction for the future

Don&#8217;t leave them flying blind for the future!  They are just going to run into the same mistake.  Provide a correction, then explain why it&#8217;s better.  Also, did you know that bees literally fly blind?  Also, that might be bats.

### 5. DON&#8217;T reflect their behavior back

It may be tempting, but don’t fall into the childhood trap of “oh, I am? Well so are you.” Reflecting the behavior will only escalate the situation, and you don’t want that, do you? Do you? DO YOU, PUNK?! I DIDN’T THINK SO!

(big thanks to Jesse in the comments for this one!)

### 6. DO reinforce positive behavior

As much as we nit-pick negative behavior, we should try to nit-pick and highlight positive stuff, particularly in folks who are still getting their footing.  It helps a lot in building confidence.  Sorry, no bee joke.

## Have some additional DOs and DON&#8217;Ts?

I&#8217;d love to hear them.  And if I&#8217;m feeling particularly creative I might even comic-ize them and update the list above.  Share them in the comments, or drop us a line on <a href="http://facebook.com/metrosam" target="_blank">facebook</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/actuallymetro" target="_blank">twitter</a>.
