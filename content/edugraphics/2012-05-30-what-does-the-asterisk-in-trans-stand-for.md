A few people have asked why I write &#8220;trans\*&#8221; (with the asterisk) instead of just &#8220;trans&#8221; when referring to trans\* folks on my site. ¬†Well, I&#8217;m happy to answer that!

<aside class="heyHeyLook wednesdayEmail"><p><span class="icon">üíå</span><strong>Most Wednesdays</strong></p><p>I publish new Social Justice, Gender, & Sexuality Resources.</p> <a class="button" title="Join my mailing list" href="http://bit.ly/2MmE28c" target="_blank"> Get the Email. </a> </aside> 


There are certainly downsides and upsides to the asterisk (similar to the @ in Latin@/Chican@, like &#8220;<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/07/168818064/latin-offers-a-gender-neutral-choice-but-how-to-pronounce-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How do you pronounce it?</a>&#8221; (with the asterisk, you don&#8217;t pronounce it), and it&#8217;s not for everyone, but you can investigate and weigh the pros and cons and decide for yourself.

I created the graphic above¬†to help raise awareness of this so folks can be more inclusive in their writing when referring to trans* people.

## About Version 2

I updated this graphic, not just visually, but in content in September 2018. Instead of publishing that as a separate post (like how I&#8217;ve done with [genderbread people][2]), I am just replacing the image on this one instead. Here&#8217;s why: Version 2 is&#8230;

  * Cuter and easier to implement on a bulletin board or in a classroom (how a ton of people have been using this graphic over the years)
  * Edited based on community feedback, including the removal of &#8220;transvestite&#8221; (which was confusing and inaccurate to include, because that&#8217;s not a trans* identity &#8212; my bad)
  * Easier to print on standard 8.5&#215;11 or A4 paper, instead of tabloid size

  <strong>Do you want the original, version 1 poster?</strong> You can find that <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/trans-poster-900.jpg">here</a>, or as a <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/TRANS-Poster-11x17.pdf">.pdf here.</a>

Since publishing the first version, [&#8220;trans*&#8221; got added to the Oxford English Dictionary][3], which is a big leap forward in layperson accessibility for this grammatical monkey wrench.

For me, intentionally including non-binary identities when talking about trans* issues, instead of perpetuating the societal mental default of binary trans identities (i.e., transmen and transwomen) is worth the extra effort &#8212; that is, assuming _you&#8217;re not_ just talking about transgender women and transgender men in a given moment. And the Alphabet Soup 2.0s that are popping up (e.g., TGNCNB for &#8220;transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary) are creating as many problems as they solve.
