  Created a <a title="When to use the word “gay” [PRINT]" href="/2012/02/when-to-use-the-word-gay-print/">printer-friendly version of the first graphic</a> (and a high-resolution version). Check it, share it, print it, love it.  Also, check out the <a title="Even better flowchart: when it’s okay to say “gay”" href="/2012/04/even-better-flowchart-when-its-okay-to-say-gay/">new-and-improved flowchart</a>.
</address>

For those of you still struggling with the idea of when it is and isn&#8217;t ideal to use the word &#8220;gay&#8221;, even after reading my <a title="If you call someone gay, he better be a guy who likes guys." href="/2011/12/if-you-call-someone-gay-he-better-be-a-guy-who-likes-guys/" target="_blank">article outlining the whole idea</a>, I decided to create a few visual aids.  Hopefully they are straightforward.  Yes, pun very much intended.

And yes, there are plenty of women who are attracted to women and are totally onboard with the term gay being used to describe them. That&#8217;s why this [new flowchart][1] is even better.
