Edugraphics are really fun to make &#8212; maybe my _favorite_ things to make. I like making these things so much I made up a word to describe them. Some fall into the categories of [gender][2], [sexuality][3], and [social justice][4]. Some are [printable][5]. All are delightful. We could just call this page Bread & Butter.
