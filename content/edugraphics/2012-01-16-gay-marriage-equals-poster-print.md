This poster is for Rick Santorum, _et al_.  Same-sex marriages are happening, gays are serving openly in the military, and the world isn&#8217;t falling apart (well, maybe it is, but it was a preexisting condition).

Yet anti-human-rights activists like Santorum and the rest of the Slippery Slopers can&#8217;t help but remind us that gay marriage is just the beginning.  In the end, we&#8217;ll all be humping household appliances.

**Print this poster and hang it with pride if you disagree.**

As with everything I make here, it&#8217;s free for you to use however you&#8217;d like.  The .PDF is of a high enough resolution to scale nicely up to full poster size, making it a great addition for a dorm room, bedroom, war room, or the side of Santorum&#8217;s campaign bus.  And the .JPGs will look great wherever you can find a home for them on the web.
