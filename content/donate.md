It&#8217;s my goal to keep this site ad-free and to continue producing quality pieces for you to read, share, and use.  If you appreciate what I&#8217;ve created here, and would like to support me so I can keep doing it, donations are a great way to do so.

## 7 Reasons to Donate to IPM

1. Everything I create here &#8212; from [genderbread people][1] to the [dirty 30s][2] &#8211;I allow others to use for free. As a testament to this, I&#8217;ve [released my copyright][3] on everything I produce.
2. I make about negative <del>$80/month</del> $400/month ([needed new hosting][4]) keeping this site running.
3. You&#8217;ve spent money on things you care about less, but can rest assured that I will sincerely appreciate and put every penny to good use.
4. If the site generated money instead of costing it, I could afford to promote articles, increase their reach, and further spread social justice goodness.
5. On the flipside of #4, donations ensure that this site will be forever free of ads and outside promotions/influences.
6. I&#8217;ll love you forever, even though I [already do][5].
7. The less time I need to spend on freelance work to pay my bills the more time I can spend here, writing articles and creating resources.

## Why don&#8217;t I have ads for revenue?

Good question.  The answer: for a couple of reasons.

The short answer is that I&#8217;m ethically against running advertisements on this site.  I don&#8217;t do ads for the same reason I shy away from reviewing anything or supporting any products: I don&#8217;t want anyone to be concerned that I&#8217;m writing for anybody but my readers.  I want to write for you &#8212; not for Google, or Adbrite, or anyone else, chalking my site and articles full of dummy links and search-engine-friendly buzzwords &#8212; even if writing just for my readers comes at a monetary cost.

Also, I experimented with advertising on the site in 2014 to see what I thought about it.  I used Google&#8217;s Adsense product to populate the ads.  Beyond normal issues of the site being slowed down and the ads loading oddly, I found that the content of the ads often conflicted with what I was trying to do here.  Advertisements for unhealthy weight loss programs, using body image issues to manipulate people into clicks, political ads that went against my message of social justice (e.g., campaign ads for _literally Ted Cruz_) &#8212; just to name a few &#8212; didn&#8217;t exactly fit in the sidebar of this site.

Finally, and this is no small grievance, Google repeatedly shut down my ad account because of the &#8220;Adult Nature&#8221; of this site (i.e., that I use the word &#8220;sex&#8221; a lot).  In order to secure consistent advertising, I would need to make my writing advertising-friendly (AKA censored and unjust), or sign on with an ad agency that did &#8220;adult&#8221; sites (i.e., porn sites), and I didn&#8217;t see either of those paths fixing any of my problems, but instead creating a whole new slew of more pernicious problems.

So no advertising is my path. And reader-funding is my new (as of 2018) path.
