Hi! I'm Sam, the real-life human being who created the thing you just saw. Do you have something you want to say in reply? 

Wonderful! I'd love to hear it. Share your reply below. I promise I'll do my best to read it. Don't count my lack of response as meaning I didn't read and consider what you had to say -- I just often have to choose between reading another reply or responding to the first one, and I always prioritize reading.
