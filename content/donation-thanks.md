**Thank you thank you thank you!** 

I means the world to me that you (a stranger on the internet) and I (another stranger on the internet) are able to connect over this cause in such a way. It really does.

Sometimes, especially these days, it can feel like the internet is a terrible place where only terrible things happen. But thanks to you &#8212; and other people like you &#8212; in this little corner of the internet truly non-terrible (anti-terrible? admirable?) things are happening.

Through this site, in the past year, here are a few of the things **you now share a joint responsibility for**:

  * In over 200 countries&#8230;
  * More than 6,000 people downloaded curriculum to educate others&#8230;
  * More than 500,000 people downloaded an edugraphic, and&#8230;
  * Over 2.5 million people read/shared an article!

And all of that was accessed for free, [without copyright][1] restrictions, as an expression of [the gift][2]. A gift you&#8217;re now part of giving.

Thanks for that. And thanks for being you.

Your accomplice in gifting,

sK
