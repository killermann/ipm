Over 1,000 of you said you&#8217;d want to participate in an [online course and community focusing on Social Justice, Minus Dogma][1]. So I&#8217;m going to hold up my end of the bargain and make the thing.

<address>
  <strong>Update! The Course + Community is officially launched. </strong>Read all about it at <a href="https://course.sjmd.space">www.sjmd.space</a>, and <a href="https://gum.co/sjmdcourse?wanted=true">sign up today</a> and you can start learning and participating in the community immediately.
</address>

First, I want to say how blown away I am that so many people are up for this. 

For a few weeks, I showed a question at the top of the site to some readers asking if you&#8217;d want to participate in a course about &#8220;social justice, minus dogma.&#8221; 

I&#8217;m wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect, but I was bracing for _bad_.

<!--more-->

In the past year plus that I&#8217;ve been talking about [Social Justice Dogma][2], I&#8217;ve become more and more aware of how pernicious it is, hearing from tons of you about how it&#8217;s showing up in your life/work, but I haven&#8217;t found a lot of hope.

One of the biggest issues is that, by its very nature, Social Justice Dogma is something that a lot of people aren&#8217;t willing, safe, and/or prepared to talk about. The [first rule of SJD is you don&#8217;t talk about SJD][3].

So I&#8217;ve written articles here, and I get emails from people saying &#8220;Thanks for writing that. I see it all the time. Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t share it because \_____.&#8221; 

And [I&#8217;ve been trying to get people to talk about Social Justice Dogma on a][4] [][5][podcast][4], and I get replies like &#8220;This is such an important conversation. I&#8217;m totally with you. Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t be on the show because \_____.&#8221; 

In both cases, the blanks are the same: a list of reasons why being public about any of this stuff will be a disaster for them, personally and/or professionally. [This elephant has found its way to][6] _[so many][6]_ [people&#8217;s rooms.][6]

The worst part: I totally get it. Talking about Social Justice Dogma has derailed my life. So far, it&#8217;s not something I can say &#8212; with any honesty &#8212; that I&#8217;m _happy_ I started writing about.

But that does not a good recipe for articles or podcast make. How are we supposed to fix problems that nobody is able to publicly talk about?

That&#8217;s where the 1,000+ of you come in. 

**The fact that over a thousand of you want to learn about this &#8212; and will help** _**me**_ **learn about it &#8212; gives me hope.**

And even if _all I have_ is hope, I&#8217;ve got plenty to work with.

## About the [Course + Community][1]

I was holding off on creating even an outline of a syllabus until I knew it was something y&#8217;all wanted, so I don&#8217;t have a lot to share today other than &#8220;I heard you loud and clear,&#8221; and some really broad, vague ideas that I have in mind.

But I do know a few things. Whatever I put together will be&#8230;

  1. [Uncopyrighted][7] and offered in the spirit of the [gift economy][8] (like everything I make here on IPM and elsewhere). Meaning **money won&#8217;t be a barrier, and I won&#8217;t restrict you using any of the course materials** in your own community / work.
  2. **Community-driven, participative, and peer facilitated.** I will be learning from you, taking what I learn and doing my best to translate it into something that benefits us all, and doing what I can to create a platform where you can learn from one another.
  3. Guided by a [social justice compass][9], with **the goal of helping you better effect social justice**, [3-dimensionally][10], in your real life, local community, and movements.
  4. Open to new learners on an ongoing, open enrollment basis. **The first cohort to sign up with have a massive impact on the overall shape of the course** &#8212; the structure, topics, community, outcomes, etc. &#8212; **but we won&#8217;t be closing the door**.

And that&#8217;s it. I have far more questions (and ideas, and vague excitements that I need to pin down) than answers right now.

I&#8217;ve already talked with some fellow [social justice people][11] (an educator, an activist, and a non-profit leader) to get their ideas. 

I&#8217;ve been thinking about this constantly for years. 

The ball is rolling. 

## More to Come. Soon.

I&#8217;ll update this post as I have more information. 

**<s>You can </s>[<s>sign up to get an invite via email when I open the course</s>][1]<s> </s>**<s>(if you already signed up, no need to do so again &#8212; I got you, boo).</s> 

**It&#8217;s live: Sign up at [www.sjmd.space][12]** 

If you&#8217;d like to help out, [let me know][13]. 

I&#8217;m here to serve.
