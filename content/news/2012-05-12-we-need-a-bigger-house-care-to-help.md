Hey folks!

After five consecutive days of breaking my hosting provider&#8217;s limits (see the Facebook status to the right), it&#8217;s time we move into a bigger house before this one explodes*.

Unfortunately, upgrading to the hosting that&#8217;s been recommended to me will cost me about 10X what I&#8217;m paying now. Â Considering I&#8217;m already making negative dollars writing and running this site, a friend and a few readers suggested that I ask for donations to help pay for the extra bandwidth, so I&#8217;m doing that.

This is a great problem to have, and I don&#8217;t mean to point fingers, but **it&#8217;s entirely your fault**.

There are a few ways we can tackle this.

### Donations to the &#8220;server fund&#8221;

Please consider a small gift to help pay for the additional bandwidth we need to allow this site to continue to grow.

### Buying a shirt from The Metro Store
