Hey y&#8217;all!

I&#8217;m going to be in Cairo for the month of June 2014. I&#8217;m going there for a bunch of reasons, but primary among those (and why I&#8217;m posting here) is because I&#8217;d love to meet some of you lovelies. **I know that I have about a thousand monthly readers in Cairo** (creepy, I know &#8212; thanks, <del>Obama</del> Google Analytics). While I&#8217;m there, if you&#8217;d like to get some coffee or food, show me around, or just say &#8220;Hi&#8221; I would love to meet you. Just get in touch, [via email][1], in comments on this page, or on [Facebook][2]/[Twitter][3].

### **Details**

  * **When:** getting in June 6th (KLM changed my flight &#8212; silly KLM), staying for at least three weeks.
  * **Where:** Cairo will be my home base, staying hostels or with friendly people, but I&#8217;ll bouncing around to different places to talk to folks.
  * **What:** let&#8217;s call it a sabbatical. I&#8217;d love to talk with and meet as many people (who are interested in gender, sexuality, social justice, or hummus) as possible. I want to hear your stories. Don&#8217;t be shy to message me [on Facebook][2] or send me an email (ideally before I get there).
  * **Stand up comedy:** I just found out I&#8217;ll be doing a set of comedy on the [English/Arabic] _Al Hezb El Comedy_ Gong Show on June 13th. Check out [their Facebook Page][4] for details. Sounds like a lot of fun, and is run by a very funny, very nice person.
  * **Writing:** I&#8217;m going to be writing a lot while I&#8217;m there. I&#8217;ll likely share at least some of that on my blog _Dear World _at [samkillermann.com][5]. Sign up for my (non-IPM) [mailing list][6] to stay tuned on that, if you&#8217;d like.
  * **Other work-ish stuff:** While this is a sabbatical, I&#8217;m happy to give some short talks, do a few comedy sets, etc. Email my manager Chum cmapa[at]novlmgmt[dawt]com and he&#8217;ll be in touch with me.

As I&#8217;ve said, this isn&#8217;t really a &#8220;work&#8221; trip, but the odds of me being back are slim, so if I can be helpful while I&#8217;m there I&#8217;m happy to do what I can. Just let me know. My schedule is incredibly flexible.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Hope to meet at least a few of you this June!</span>

With love,

sK
