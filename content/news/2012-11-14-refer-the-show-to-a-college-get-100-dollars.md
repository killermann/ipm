## FAQ (forecasted asked questions):

**When do I get my dollars?**

Once we have a signed contract between me and the school booking the show, I&#8217;ll send you a check (or a large jar of pennies).

**Is there a limit to the amount of schools I can refer?**

Is there a limit to the amount of hugs you can give sad-looking strangers?  The answer: no.

**Can I do this if I work for the school that books you?**

This is an ethical quandary, for sure.  I&#8217;ll let you decide what the appropriate answer is.

**Can I do this if I&#8217;m a student at the school that books you?**

Absolutely.  Consider yourself an _It&#8217;s Pronounced Metrosexual_ ambassador.

**Anything I&#8217;m missing?**

Ask it in the comments below and I&#8217;ll update this list.
