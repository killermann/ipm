Watch the preview below for &#8220;Second Class Citizens&#8221;, an under-production documentary about the Gay Rights Movement.  The project is being <a title="Second Class Citizens Kickstarter" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ryanjamesyezak/second-class-citizens-documentary" target="_blank">funded on Kickstarter</a> (Kickstarter video _way_ below), and has raised over $145K at the time of this writing (300% of its goal).  You can still back the documentary receive perks (posters, DVDs, etc.), but at this point it would be more helpful **to share the message**.

&#8220;Like&#8221; the project on Kickstarter, Tweet about it, call your mom and be like, &#8220;yo momma, so there&#8217;s this documentary I want to tell you about,&#8221; do whatever you do, just do it!

I&#8217;ll be covering this documentary once it&#8217;s released, and I&#8217;m **very much** looking forward to it.  Hopefully you will spread the word and help make it happen.
