If you see this badge, it means that the person, website, or social media page that shared it is a safe space for people of all identities. They are taking an active advocacy stance in whatever work they are doing and will not tolerate pejorative language or other bigoted behavior in their space.

If you want to make it clear to your community that you are dedicated to making it a safe, inclusive, welcoming space, use the images below (code included) in any way you would like to do so.

I created these to recognize <a title="IDAHO" href="http://www.homophobiaday.org/" target="_blank">International Day Against Homophobia (IDAHO)</a>, but wanted to create something that could exist beyond a single day. Allyship is a lifelong commitment, but it starts with one day.

There are transparent and solid background options for each image. And down below there are high resolution versions of the three main options.

## Terms of Use and Thanks

The &#8220;terms of use&#8221; for this image is simple: use them however you&#8217;d like, just don&#8217;t sell them. That&#8217;s it. You can modify it, not link to my site, link to someone else&#8217;s site &#8212; I really don&#8217;t care. Just don&#8217;t sell it (on a t-shirt, poster, printed in a book, etc.) and I&#8217;ll be a happy camper. If you have an idea for use and you&#8217;re not sure (cuz it&#8217;s grey in the &#8220;selling&#8221; area), just [get in touch][1].

**And finally, a huge thanks to [@michnic][2] on Twitter for encouraging me to make these!**
