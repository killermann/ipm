Hi friends! I&#8217;m going to keep this short. I just put together [an E-Book called &#8220;Defining LGBTQ+.&#8221;][1] It&#8217;s a guide to gender and sexuality terminology, based on my article [Comprehensive List of LGBTQ+ Vocabulary Definitions][2], which was based on the glossary from my first book ([A Guide to Gender][3]), that grew into a collaboration with [Meg Bolger](https://megbolger.com) ([The Safe Zone Project][4]) and thousands of you.

Now, before you get too excited, it&#8217;s not really a book-book. Think of it more like an elaborately annotated glossary, or a dictionary with way too much context.

The deets:

  * **It&#8217;s short.** It weighs in at 37 pages and about 10,000 words. 
  * **It&#8217;s printer-friendly.** I formatted to look great on an 8.5&#8243; x 11&#8243; letter size (sorry to my A4 friends abroad &#8212; if enough of you ask, I&#8217;ll format it in A4 as well!)
  * **It&#8217;s uncopyrighted**. Like [everything else I make here][5], so you can modify it and use it in your educational endeavors.
  * **It&#8217;s a work in progress.** Just like my original post, I&#8217;ll update this continually with changes suggested by you, and to reflect the evolution of culture.
  * **It&#8217;s pay-what-you-want/can.** You can get it for free, or choose to pay (whatever amount you _can_ or _want to_ pay, even $0! I&#8217;m happy to provide this as my gift to you). I&#8217;m delivering this via [Gumroad][6] (instead of as a .PDF download here) to make it easier to update you when I improve it or fix tpyos.

There&#8217;s a big ol&#8217; backstory behind it that I might get into at some point, but right now I just want to keep it at that. 

This is a thing that a lot of you asked for, and you now you can have it. 

Share it with a friend, print a copy for your parent(s), or add it to a new employee orientation handbook. Do you. I&#8217;m here to help.

Want to check it out? All you need to do is click the button below, then follow the prompts, and a download link will be sent to your email. Then [let me know][7] what you think!

(Oh, and don&#8217;t worry &#8212; I won&#8217;t add you to the [general IPM email list][8]. You have to sign up for that yourself. You&#8217;ll only get emails when there&#8217;s an improved E-Book for you to download. I absolutely hate spam email, and when someone adds me to their email list without my consent. I won&#8217;t do that to you.)
