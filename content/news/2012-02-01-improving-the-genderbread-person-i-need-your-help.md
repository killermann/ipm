  <strong>Update of updates:</strong> thanks to thousands of messages and tons of conversations, I released Genderbread Person v3 (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetroSam/photos/pb.216393541757516.-2207520000.1403371597./684315374965328/?type=1&#038;theater">here&#8217;s the most recent iteration</a>) with <a href="http://guidetogender.com" alt="A Guide to Gender">my book</a>. The outpouring of constructive feedback was overwhelming. Thank you.

Hey friends, here&#8217;s the thing:

I made this [graphic][1] about a month ago, made a [printer-friendly][2] version about a week ago, and sometime in the last five days it **erupted** (a &#8220;ton of views and traffic&#8221; eruption, not a &#8220;lava and ash and destruction&#8221; eruption). Â It&#8217;s been viewed close to 500,000 times (that&#8217;s half a million) _that I can account for_. Â But there&#8217;s a problem.

**The Genderbread Person I created is far from perfect.**

<aside class="heyHeyLook wednesdayEmail"><p><span class="icon">ðŸ’Œ</span><strong>Most Wednesdays</strong></p><p>I publish new Social Justice, Gender, & Sexuality Resources.</p> <a class="button" title="Join my mailing list" href="http://bit.ly/2MmE28c" target="_blank"> Get the Email. </a> </aside> 

I sought to improve upon previous versions, and though I did so, there&#8217;s still a lot of room for improvement, particularly in the area of sexual orientation. Â I&#8217;ve received hundreds of comments, emails, and DMs to the effect of &#8220;it&#8217;s great, other than the sexual orientation part&#8221;, but not too many provide a working solution.

**Help me solve this dilemma and get a better Genderbread Person up for the next half million views.**

Below is the best revision I have so far, so perhaps we can start there. Â Leave your constructive criticisms and suggestions in the comments below. Â If the suggestion already exists, **vote that suggestion up**, don&#8217;t leave a duplicate.

What do you think? Â Can we equality and progress be crowd-sourced? Â I think so. Â Let&#8217;s find out.

### UPDATE #1

Please keep in mind that this graphic should be simple and easily understood. Â It&#8217;s mean to be printed and stand alone as an educational piece, not needing further explanation. Â Great suggestions so far, folks. Â Keep it up!
