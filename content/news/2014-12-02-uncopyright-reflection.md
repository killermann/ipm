I gave a keynote recently, and after someone (a sexual health educator) found me at the conference. &#8220;I just wanted to thank you,&#8221; they started.

## Remembering the Journey

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2818 lazy-load" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/share-borrow-steal.jpg" alt="share-borrow-steal" width="400" height="271" data-srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/share-borrow-steal.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/11/share-borrow-steal-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />This site started with a message in the [about page][1]: &#8220;Share/Borrow/Steal.&#8221; It took a couple years to get to the point of _uncopyrighting_ with [a carte blanche, yes-I&#8217;m-sure blog post][2]. At face value, they appear to be twin messages, but they&#8217;re actually quite distant cousins.

### &#8220;You really shouldn&#8217;t do that.&#8221; &#8211; Everyone

Not many people navigated to the page with the Share/Borrow/Steal (S/B/S) mantra, but many of those who did would write in with warnings. This message was also reflected in-person during interactions with other creatives, social justice people, authors, and doodlers. This message that manifested in many iterations:

&#8220;You need to protect yourself.&#8221;

&#8220;You need to make a living.&#8221;

&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be a martyr to accomplish your goals.&#8221;

I heard this on a regular basis for years, and moreso as I further embraced my S/B/S mentality with a [Creative Commons][3] license (my awkward puberty phase between S/B/S and Uncopyright). That phase was thankfully short, a swift but necessary supportive lilly pad between resisting the world we&#8217;re in and embracing &#8220;the more beautiful world [my] heart knows is possible.¹&#8221;

The S/B/S idea was important to me. It demonstrated a core social justice value of mine: access. Social justice is about removing barriers and creating an equitable society, so, to me, putting up financial barriers between Folks Who Want to Learn and the Learning is inimical. My S/B/S statement was, as I said above, a form of resistance:

_Society is broken. Capitalism creates financial barriers that foster its further broken-ness. I&#8217;ll encourage people to subvert capitalism, at least in this space, by &#8220;stealing&#8221; my work instead of paying for it._

Resistance is important. But I wasn&#8217;t fully embracing my want for better in admonishing the status quo. I had internalized so many messages of capitalism, scarcity, and competition that I couldn&#8217;t fully embrace my hope, but walk this &#8220;have my cake and eat it too&#8221; line where I maintained my &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; while encouraging others to rob me of it. This was received as a mixed message that I saw in a lot of emails (&#8220;Are you sure this is okay?&#8221;), one that accurately reflected the mixed feelings bubbling around inside me.

To make change, things have to change.

### &#8220;You _REALLY _shouldn&#8217;t do _THAT.&#8221; &#8211; _Everyone, louder, and also Myself

A series of experiences catalyzed my transition from S/B/S to Uncopyright.

  1. Readers kept sending me links to things I made (like [this][4]) popping up for sale on products (like T-shirts and mugs), without permission. This violated the only exception in my S/B/S agreement, basically &#8220;don&#8217;t sell stuff I drew.&#8221; And while it violated the copyright, and the spirit of my generosity, when readers linked me I would always reply, &#8220;That&#8217;s unfortunate,&#8221; then go back to whatever I was doing. I never pursued any legal action, nor would I. _So why keep the copyright? &#8220;Just in case&#8221; was a phrase that kept ringing in my ears, but ringing wrong somehow._
  2. I started exploring alternatives. I found Creative Commons. Thought it was perfect. Relicensed my site under a [CC, non-commercial, share alike license][5]. After doing that, I kept getting questions about usage, replying with my laissez faire stance, and wondering how I could better communicate this. Then I looked more into Creative Commons and realized [it did not mean what I thought it meant][6]: I still maintained all copyrights, it was just a way of communicating in legalese my previous S/B/S policy. _Same song, different melody. I want to sing a different song, the one I hear in my heart._
  3. Meanwhile, I was in talks with publishers about [my first book][7]. I desperately wanted (demanded) there to be some free way to access it, even if just electronically. I couldn&#8217;t get anyone behind me on this. They saw it as literary suicide. _They&#8217;re singing that song, too. We all are. It&#8217;s a world anthem._
  4. _ _Investigating all this, I started seeing other creatives who were utilizing different licenses and approaches to their work. This was exciting. I learned about [copyleft][8], [CC freeworks][9], and others. Then I read [Leo Babauta&#8217;s][10] [uncopyright statement on Zen Habits][11]. _Holy shit, that&#8217;s radical. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the song._

I told a few colleagues of my newfound desire to uncopyright my work here as an experiment. I shared the idea with the same nervous excitement of introducing your best friend to a new romantic partner: _oh gosh oh gosh I hope they hit it off I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll do if they don&#8217;t oh gosh oh gosh oh gosh._

They didn&#8217;t hit it off.

**&#8220;You need to protect yourself&#8221; **was a different way of saying the world is broken, and you cannot trust strangers. It affirmed a fear I kept hearing in my own mind: if you don&#8217;t look out for yourself, nobody else will. _This is going to backfire._

**&#8220;You need to make a living&#8221;** was a threat as much as a promise. It echoed the messages I&#8217;d heard my whole life, that if I don&#8217;t put a value on my work, and make people pay for it, nobody would value it, and I would starve. _I can&#8217;t trust the generosity of strangers._

**&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be a martyr to accomplish your goals&#8221;** is something we say to a lot of activists and other social good workers. It&#8217;s a preemptive defense, because a lot of us come from troubled pasts and feel guilty doing this work if we&#8217;re not still suffering. But it&#8217;s also a reflection of the system that creates the problems we&#8217;re trying to solve: first and foremost, look out for #1. _We are in competition with one another, and giving your work away is giving up on yourself._

What was scariest was they were saying the things I was telling myself, when I wanted (needed) them to tell me otherwise. Luckily, as I struggled with this decision, the loudest voice I heard, the voice I always hear when I really listen, was Atwood&#8217;s:

> “Thrown over a precipice, you fall or else you fly; you clutch at any hope, however unlikely; however – if I may use such an overworked word – miraculous. What we mean by that is, Against all odds.”

I threw myself [over the precipice][12].

## ¹&#8221;The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know Is Possible&#8221;

That phrase comes from Charles Eisenstein. In the past year, since the over precipice throwing, I&#8217;ve been craving connection to others who had made a similar commitment. People who might be able to help me fly. At the start, it was [Leo][13]. Most recently, it&#8217;s been [Charles][14] and [Amanda Palmer][15].

I read Eisenstein&#8217;s book [_Sacred Economics_][16] and it was like hearing my own voice, but in a clearer, smarter, more economically-savvy way. It was powerful. **I recommend _everyone_ read that book**, and believe that if everyone did the world would change for the better. He paints an [incredibly optimistic, slammed by many as hopelessly naïve] view of an economic system that sounds a lot to me like social justice, without ever using the phrase. It&#8217;s helped me clarify my own world, my relationship with my work and &#8220;intellectual property,&#8221; and root it all in a more concrete objective.

I read Palmer&#8217;s _[The Art of Asking][17] _and it helped me empathize with an artist struggling to occupy an ideal world, while living in the current one. A book that (and [person who][18]) has received a veritable [mountain of criticism][19] (e.g., the would-be [_coup de grâce_][20]), some of which I understand the origin of and some of which I question. But the empathy the book evoked has helped me [better understand][21], in the context of today&#8217;s world. Her. Her art. My art. _Art__._

These two books, and a bunch of otheressays, emails, and conversations I&#8217;ve had have left me knowing something better than I knew it before I started all this, the answer to the question of whether or not it&#8217;s &#8220;okay&#8221; for me to uncopyright my work, or if the world is ready for this: the answer was and is an emphatic &#8220;NO.&#8221;

But a year of learning and asking and processing and reflecting, while watching my little [experiment][12] pan out, has left me with one resounding sentiment: YES.

Uncopyrighting my work has protected myself from participating more than I need to in an unjust system I&#8217;m trying to subvert. **Can everyone do it? Nope. Should everyone do it (or should folks who don&#8217;t feel ashamed they still maintain their IP)? Absolutely not. But more people can than do, and the fear that is preventing all of us from embracing this idea is a massive barrier to justice.

ative system I hope the world will embody someday: one where everyone, of all identities, has equitable access to resources, love, and justice, and nobody has to ask for permission to smile.
