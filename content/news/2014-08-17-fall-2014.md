I&#8217;ll be bouncing around a lot this fall and I&#8217;d love to see you. Below are the major cities I&#8217;m going to in the next few weeks. We can call this the _Let&#8217;s Be Friends! Tour, Fall 2014 Edition._

{{< heyheylook >}}

This is something that I get asked about on a regular basis. I&#8217;m generally reluctant to announce the performances/speaking gigs I&#8217;m doing beforehand, because the nature of what I do online leads to <a href="http://www.guidetogender.com/2014/01/11/nom-attempted-a-hate-piece-against-me-and-the-genderbread-person/" target="_blank">plenty</a> <a title="One reason I’m a social justice advocate (as a white, straight, male)" href="/2012/02/one-reason-i-do-what-i-do/" target="_blank">of</a> <a title="Being an Ally Between a Rock and a Hard Place" href="/2013/05/being-an-ally-between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place/" target="_blank">detractors</a>. In the past, when I&#8217;ve promoted that I&#8217;d be keynoting a conference or performing my show, there has occasionally been backlash from some of these groups. That said, I&#8217;ve decided the positives outweigh the negatives. And the haters, well, they gonna hate. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD9A8x_xn5g" target="_blank"><em>That&#8217;s just the way it is</em></a>.

Below are the broad details of some of the places I&#8217;ll be <a title="A show about snap judgments, identity, and oppression." href="/a-show-about-snap-judgments-identity-and-oppression/" target="_blank">performing my show</a> or speaking this fall. If you want to set something up while I&#8217;m there, <a title="Contact the Powers that Be" href="/contact/" target="_blank">get in touch</a> super fast. I&#8217;d love to do additional shows, am happy to do coffee meet-ups, <a href="http://guidetogender.com" target="_blank">book</a>-related things, an in-person interview, or just to say &#8220;Hi!&#8221; IRL. Frealz.

## New: It&#8217;s Pronounced _Chitown_

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2708 lazy-load" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/its-pronounced-chicago.jpg" alt="its-pronounced-chicago" width="1000" height="200" />
  
I&#8217;ll be making a short stop in my hometown in **the middle of October**. I&#8217;ll be doing some gendery stuff, an IPM show, and scheduling some meetings.

<div class="fourcol last clearfix" style="text-align: right;">
  <a href="mailto:cmapa@novlmgmt.com?CC=booking@0afb8f23-e02f-4bd2-a9ce-bafa1dce6d8c.app.getshifter.io&Subject=IPM%20CHI%3A%20%5BADD%20SUBJECT%5D&Body=***Please%20be%20as%20detailed%20as%20possible%20and%20we%27ll%20get%20right%20back%20to%20you.%20If%20you%20just%20want%20to%20get%20in%20touch%20with%20only%20Sam%20personally%2C%20you%20can%20email%20hime%20directly%20sam@0afb8f23-e02f-4bd2-a9ce-bafa1dce6d8c.app.getshifter.io.***" target="_blank"><span class="button">Email for Chitown <i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i></span></a>
</div>

Though it&#8217;s going quick, I still have **a bunch of** extra time for:

  * Additional shows / formal bookings, interviews
  * Informal pop-ins to orgs / businesses to say hi and wax social justice for an hour or so
  * Chicago Diner Dining (it&#8217;s been too long, and word on the street is they may have <a href="/2014/07/how-the-gender-neutral-bathroom-sign-i-made-is-being-manufactured-and-donated-to-colleges/" title="How the Gender Neutral Bathroom Sign I Made is Being Manufactured and Donated to Colleges" target="_blank">some signage</a> I want to check out)

## It&#8217;s Pronounced _New Yohk City_

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2708 lazy-load" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/its-pronounced-nyc.jpg" alt="its-pronounced-nyc" width="1000" height="200" data-srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/its-pronounced-nyc.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/08/its-pronounced-nyc-300x60.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />
  
I&#8217;ll be in NYC [at least] twice this fall. First time: **the week of Monday, August 18**. The second trip is the **second week in October**. I&#8217;ll be there doing IPM shows at a few schools, popping into bookstores, and some other gendery stuff.

</div>

At this point, I have **some** extra time for:

  * Additional shows / formal bookings, interviews
  * Informal pop-ins to orgs / businesses to say hi and wax social justice for an hour or so
  * Bagels (I take mine with hummus, please)

## It&#8217;s Pronounced _C-Attle_

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2715 lazy-load" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/its-pronounced-seattle.jpg" alt="its-pronounced-seattle" width="1000" height="200" data-srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/its-pronounced-seattle.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/08/its-pronounced-seattle-300x60.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />

I find myself in Seattle/Tacoma area so much and I&#8217;m not even a little bit mad. I&#8217;ll be there **the first week of September**. And have a wiggling, tingling sensation I&#8217;ll be back later in the fall. (Oh, and if you got <a title="C-Attle" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__3EZmzmIQs" target="_blank">that &#8220;c-attle&#8221; joke</a>, let&#8217;s be friends)

<div class="fourcol last clearfix" style="text-align: right;">
  <a href="mailto:cmapa@novlmgmt.com?CC=booking@0afb8f23-e02f-4bd2-a9ce-bafa1dce6d8c.app.getshifter.io&Subject=IPM%20SEA%3A%20%5BADD%20SUBJECT%5D&Body=***Please%20be%20as%20detailed%20as%20possible%20and%20we%27ll%20get%20right%20back%20to%20you.%20If%20you%20just%20want%20to%20get%20in%20touch%20with%20only%20Sam%20personally%2C%20you%20can%20email%20hime%20directly%20sam@0afb8f23-e02f-4bd2-a9ce-bafa1dce6d8c.app.getshifter.io.***" target="_blank"><span class="button">Email for Seattle <i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i></span></a>
</div>

At this point, I have **a bunch of** extra time for:

  * Additional shows / formal bookings, interviews
  * Informal pop-ins to orgs / businesses to say hi and wax social justice for an hour or so
  * Coffee snobbery (I know this place that has an _amazing _house blend you have to try)

## It&#8217;s Pronounced _Hooston_

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2714 lazy-load" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/its-pronounced-houston.jpg" alt="its-pronounced-houston" width="1000" height="200" data-srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/its-pronounced-houston.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/08/its-pronounced-houston-300x60.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />

I rarely get to do anything in the south, let alone in my now-home-state Texas, so this is exciting for me. I&#8217;ll be in Houston **the first week of October** doing a few IPM shows. The dates are flexible, so this trip can easily be bookended with additional shows / talks.

<div class="fourcol last clearfix" style="text-align: right;">
  <a href="mailto:cmapa@novlmgmt.com?CC=booking@0afb8f23-e02f-4bd2-a9ce-bafa1dce6d8c.app.getshifter.io&Subject=IPM%20HOU%3A%20%5BADD%20SUBJECT%5D&Body=***Please%20be%20as%20detailed%20as%20possible%20and%20we%27ll%20get%20right%20back%20to%20you.%20If%20you%20just%20want%20to%20get%20in%20touch%20with%20only%20Sam%20personally%2C%20you%20can%20email%20hime%20directly%20sam@0afb8f23-e02f-4bd2-a9ce-bafa1dce6d8c.app.getshifter.io.***" target="_blank"><span class="button">Email for Houston <i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i></span></a>
</div>

At this point, I have **a bunch of** extra time for:

  * Additional shows / formal bookings, interviews
  * Informal pop-ins to orgs / businesses to say hi and wax social justice for an hour or so
  * Line dancing (as long as I can wear my leopard print pants)

## It&#8217;s Pronounced _Dez Moynez_

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2714 lazy-load" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/its-pronounced-des-moines.jpg" alt="its-pronounced-des-moines" width="1000" height="200" />

(Actually, it&#8217;s not. But when I was a kid I _may have_ thought it was) I&#8217;m more excited to go back to Des Moines than you will likely believe, which is why I&#8217;m including it in my major cities (asteism unintended). I&#8217;ll **be there in November** keynoting a <a href="http://www.eyesopeniowa.org/listen-connect-support-conference/" alt="Eyes Open Iowa">pretty awesome conference</a> (as well as visiting my heart after I left it there last spring).

</div>

At this point, I have **some** extra time for:

  * Informal pop-ins to orgs / businesses to say hi and wax social justice for an hour or so
  * Interviews or book signings
  * Doing monk stuff (you&#8217;ll be able to inform me what this might be, I hope, considering you&#8217;re the city of it)

## I hope to see some of you on the road!

This whole &#8220;telling people where I&#8217;m gonna be and hoping they&#8217;ll want to meet me in real life and talk about stuff&#8221; experiment went better than I would have ever guessed when <a title="I’m Heading to Cairo — Wanna hang?" href="/2014/04/sam-killermann-in-cairo/" target="_blank">I was in the Middle East this past summer</a>. I met some wonderful people &#8212; people who I won&#8217;t be forgetting, and would be sad now if I had to un-know &#8212; all through the magic of the internet. The internet <a title="I Have Not Given You Consent" href="/2014/04/i-have-not-given-you-consent/" target="_blank">isn&#8217;t always bad</a>. Let&#8217;s make the most of it.

See you this fall,
