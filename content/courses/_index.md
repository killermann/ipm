Learn about gender, sexuality, & social justice with [me](/about/about-sam-killermann) in a more directed, exploratory fashion. Some of the courses I create (and co-create) are short, lasting a few hours. Others are long, lasting many weeks. All are offered [freely in the gift economy](/gift-economy/).
