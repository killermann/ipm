  Frequently Answered Questions

<h4 style="text-align: left;">
  Where does the money go?
</h4>

Right now, every penny of a donation goes directly into purchasing and delivering promotional materials (flyers, postcards, business cards) to continue reaching out to schools about _It&#8217;s Pronounced Metrosexual_.

#### Is it possible to specify (eartag) where my donation goes?

Yes! If you have a particular goal for your donation, please let us know. We&#8217;d be happy to work with you to make that goal happen.  A few examples of ways donations could be utilized are school-specific/org-specific campaigns, Google Adwords, college publication ad space, association memberships, guerilla campaigns, etc.

#### Is there a possibility to sponsor or co-produce the show?

<div id="q3">
  <p>
    Absolutely! As long as you or your organization&#8217;s values align with ours, we are open to discussing sponsorships. Benefits of sponsorship include (but are certainly not limited to) advertising on our promotional materials (website, postcards, playbills, buisness cards, etc.), producer credits on CDs and DVDs, and mention during introduction at live shows.

  <h4>
    Is there a minimum/maximum value allowed for donations?
  </h4>
  
  <div id="q4">
    <p>
      As of now, we can&#8217;t imagine a reason to turn any donation down. Every dollar pledged equals a postcard we can print and mail to a school, and at this point even the most generous donations can be accommodated and channeled directly into the show.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      Are you accepting donations in any form other than PayPal?
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      PayPal is the preferred method of donating, but we are happy to accept donations in any form (spare change on the street, a check in the mail), including in-kind donations of printing materials/services or postage. If you are interested in providing an alternative donation, just <a title="Contact" href="/contact/">get in touch.</a>
