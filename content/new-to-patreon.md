Patreon is a platform that lets people (patrons) support people (creators) they dig.

As a patron, you get to choose your monthly level of support, and in doing so gain access to exclusive &#8220;rewards&#8221; that are only available to Patreon supporters.

In general, every&nbsp; patron gets access to the Patron-only feed, which is basically a mini-blog on that platform where creators (me!) can post updates, notes, articles, or other things for their patrons.

For this site specifically, because I give everything away free &&nbsp;[uncopyrighted][1], I&#8217;m using the patron-only feed to write &#8220;behind-the-scenes&#8221; type stuff that IPM fans or social justice nerds might dig.

And depending on your monthly gift, you can also access other rewards. The stuff I&#8217;m offering right now is stickers and handwritten notes, but if people ask for different things I&#8217;m amenable. I&#8217;m new to this, so I&#8217;m looking for lots of feedback.

If you&#8217;re familiar with Kickstarter (or Indiegogo, or other &#8220;crowdfunding&#8221; platforms), you can think of Patreon as being a Kickstarter for an ongoing project/creation (vs. a one-time thing).
