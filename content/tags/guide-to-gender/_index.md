All of these posts are included in some way in my book, [_A Guide to Gender: The Social Justice Advocate's Handbook_](/books/guide-to-gender). Some were written for the book then I published them here, other were first published here then included in the book. All are uncopyrighted, and yours to use _a la carte_ in lesson plans, curricula, or even other books.
