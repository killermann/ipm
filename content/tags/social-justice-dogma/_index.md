<p style="font-size: 1.4em;" class="alt-font"><strong>The Social Justice Dogma (SJD)</strong> is the set of beliefs, stances, and acceptable actions laid down by the authorities within the social justice movement that we hold as incontrovertibly true.</p>

This idea was coined when I wrote the article ["I canâ€™t stop thinking about the 'Social Justice Dogma,' or keeping quiet."](/2017/12/introduction-social-justice-dogma/) and has evolved into a collection of essays, podcasts, and even [an online course](/courses/social-justice-minus-dogma-course/).
