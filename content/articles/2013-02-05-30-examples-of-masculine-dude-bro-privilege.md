excerpt: A bit cheekier than my other privilege lists, this one focuses on the unearned benefits the bros in our society get, that the more feminine guys (like moi) do not.

I&#8217;ve written a few [privilege lists][1], several of which are about privileged identities I possess. They are serious articles that provide a couple hundred examples of systemic oppression (in the US and elsewhere). This article is not that.

I ask that you please humor me as I take a moment to address the many privileges I _don&#8217;t _have access to, due to my gender expression/ metrosexuality. Also, please note that this list is equal parts true and funny-because-it&#8217;s-true (think of it like that expression &#8220;I&#8217;m just kidding, but seriously.&#8221;), but not meant to stand against the other privilege lists. It&#8217;s more of an autobiographical reflection on my metrosexuality &#8212; a lot of things that came up as I was writing my [forthcoming book about gender][2] &#8212; presented in a familiar way. Now, in true privilege list format&#8230;

Following is a list of privileges granted to masculine dudes (i.e., a &#8220;bro&#8221;) based on their bro-ness. Odds are, if you&#8217;re a bro, you don&#8217;t realize you have exclusive access to these things, and bro about your day unbroknownst to the brovantages you broceive.

If you&#8217;re a masculine dude&#8230;

  1. <span style="line-height: 12.997159004211426px;">You have never <em>thought</em> you dated someone for several weeks, only to find out that the whole time she thought you were just her &#8220;Gay Bee-Eff-Eff!&#8221;</span>
  2. And that has definitely never happened twice. In the same semester. Your first year of college.
  3. When confronting a girl you _thought_ you dated by saying, &#8220;But we made out!&#8221; you&#8217;ve never had to attempt to make sense of the onion-of-layered-confusion response, &#8220;I just thought that&#8217;s what all gay people did.&#8221; Actually, you&#8217;ve never had to do the first part, so moot point.
  4. You don&#8217;t consider and reconsider your sock choice before a first date, debating wearing what seems right to you (teal argyle to complement your salmon pants) or what is least likely to result in your date deciding you&#8217;re too femme or gay (white socks with grey shoes &#8212; try not to vomit).
  5. Similarly, you never feel pressured to tone down your gender expression in your clothing choices. And you definitely don&#8217;t have a personal rule that &#8220;only the top OR the bottom can be feminine&#8221; (not counting shoes and accessories, of course) (also, not _that_ &#8220;top&#8221; and &#8220;bottom&#8221;).
  6. If you&#8217;re straight, you can reasonably assume that people will correctly assume your sexuality, and don&#8217;t find yourself constantly having to &#8220;come out&#8221; as straight.
  7. If you&#8217;re straight, you&#8217;ve never had someone argue with you (or attempt to &#8220;correct&#8221; you) when you tell them your sexuality (&#8220;No, I think the word you&#8217;re looking for is &#8216;queer&#8217;, son.&#8221;).
  8. If you&#8217;re straight, you&#8217;ve never had to deal with the awkwardness of being set-up on a surprise date with someone-you-know&#8217;s gay friend.
  9. You don&#8217;t have a monthly &#8220;hair product&#8221; budget. And you definitely never find yourself raising the debt ceiling on your monthly &#8220;hair product&#8221; budget.
 10. You feel comfortable wearing sweat pants and a t-shirt as an &#8220;outfit,&#8221; instead of considering that to be what you wear while coordinating an outfit.
 11. You&#8217;ve never felt the need to say the phrase &#8220;coordinating an outfit.&#8221;
 12. You generally receive clothing as gifts that you could actually see yourself wearing.
 13. It&#8217;s easy to find &#8220;men&#8217;s&#8221; clothing that aligns with your style/wants, and fits in a comfortable way.
 14. It&#8217;s easy for you to choose an outfit for an event based on the dress code (e.g., formal = suit and tie; business casual = khakis and polo), and you don&#8217;t have to ask a series of clarifying questions (e.g., &#8220;how onboard are we with light scarves?&#8221;) to avoid offending the host.
 15. It&#8217;s also easy to find men in movies and television shows whose gender expression and sexuality align with yours, and who aren&#8217;t just the butt-end of a joke (admittedly, this is getting much easier in the past couple years than it was when I was growing up &#8212; thanks R. Gos!).
 16. You have genuinely wondered, from a position of true ignorance, &#8220;why do women wear high heels if they are so uncomfortable?&#8221;
 17. Accordingly, you&#8217;ve never worn pants that were so tight you called them &#8220;Yoko&#8221; because they broke up &#8220;the band.&#8221;
 18. &#8220;Grooming&#8221; is getting your hair cut once a month, and occasionally shaving, not a daily, multi-tool, elaborate science.
 19. You likely don&#8217;t feel the need to own any of the following: tweezers, blackhead extractor, nail file, conditioner, mousse, blowdryer, facial moisturizer.
 20. &#8220;Facial moisturizer&#8221; is a punchline to a &#8220;that&#8217;s what she said&#8221; joke, not a nail-biting cliffhanging thought you can&#8217;t get out of your head as you consider what you may have forgotten to pack while on a flight to perform in Phoenix.
 21. You&#8217;re not constantly aware/sensitive to how you smell. Though, to be frank, everyone else is (stinko).
 22. People don&#8217;t assume they can ask you to help them go shopping, and force you to either acknowledge their stereotyping of you or lie on principle and pretend you won&#8217;t love that.
 23. You never find yourself pretending to be interested in sports you don&#8217;t care about, which leads to awkward conversations where you are weighing in on things you know nothing about, but have developed a vague-but-specific method of conversing that keeps you under cover (albeit stressfully so): &#8220;Yeah, they&#8217;re looking pretty good this year, at least compared to previous years and/or other teams that play sport in this arena.&#8221;
 24. You can wear a sports jersey without people thinking you&#8217;re being ironic.
 25. People are never so surprised when it turns out you&#8217;re actually good at sports that they start to question their sobriety.
 26. When people realize you own a hammer (or other tools), they don&#8217;t assume they were part of some Village People-esque halloween costume, but instead assume you know how to use them to, you know, hammer stuff.
 27. Similarly, people aren&#8217;t surprised when you&#8217;re into any &#8220;bro&#8221; stuff (e.g., beer, video games, science, wearing socks with sandals).
 28. You never have to translate the words that pop into your head (e.g., &#8220;cute cardigan&#8221;) into brocceptable terminology before saying them (e.g., &#8220;solid sweater&#8221;).
 29. You&#8217;ve never been beaten up because of your gender expression. Though, in seriousness, it&#8217;s likely that the pressures of bro-ness led to some of my (and my metro brethren&#8217;s) many adolescent beatings, and some of the aggressors were just as afflicted by gender role pressures as I was.
 30. Similarly serious, you never feel pressured to participate in objectifying, borderline misogynistic conversations about women that make you uncomfortable, for fear of people questioning your manhood if you don&#8217;t.
 31. <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">People don&#8217;t laugh when you describe yourself as a &#8220;real man,&#8221; thinking it&#8217;s a joke, because EVERYTHING IS AN EFFING JOKE TO SOME PEOPLE!</span>
 32. Other metrosexual guys out there, feel free to share more examples in the replies below (:

_Additions from readers:_

  * <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t ever have to worry if your v neck is too low, because chances are the only v necks you own are undershirts.&#8221; (from Zak, my <em>actual</em> brother! :))</span>
  * &#8220;You&#8217;ve never had to move your family to a bigger apartment so that you could have your own closet and bathroom.&#8221;

P.S. Hope you didn&#8217;t take that too seriously and it was fun for both of us.
  
P.P.S. That&#8217;s what my first college &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; told me after we &#8220;broke up.&#8221;
