How about not?

Following is an email I just received from Change.org that I felt compelled to share.  Please read it, consider it, and spend two minutes making an effort to save thousands of lives.

> **Citibank and Barclays could save the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in Uganda.**
> 
> The Ugandan legislature could vote any day on a so-called “Kill the Gays” bill that could result in legalizing the death penalty for any LGBT person in the country. But Citibank and Barclays together have hundreds of millions of dollars invested in Uganda and wield significant influence in the country, just as banking lobbyists wield influence with Congress in the US. **If Citibank and Barclays speak out against the &#8220;Kill the Gays&#8221; bill, Ugandan legislators will take notice in a hurry.**

> Collin Burton is a Citibank customer &#8212; he’s also gay. <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/citibank-and-barclays-condemn-ugandas-kill-the-gays-bill?utm_source=action_alert&utm_medium=email&me=aa&alert_id=ngIOIoqocF_xscicZFFDS" target="_blank"><strong>Collin started a petition on Change.org asking Citibank and Barclays to speak out against the &#8220;Kill the Gays&#8221; bill.

> 
> Citibank and Barclays are both big supporters of LGBT rights for their own employees, yet they invest money with a government that is threatening to execute LGBT people. **&#8220;I expect Citibank and Barclays to live up to the values of equality and fairness, not just list them on their websites,&#8221; Collin says.**

> If Citibank and Barclays speak out against the &#8220;Kill the Gays&#8221; bill, Ugandan legislators will see that they are risking the business relationships that keep their government afloat.
