To achieve social justice we will have to break down a lot of huge barriers that exist on a scale far above the individual, but even the biggest scale change is nothing more than the sum of _a whole lot_ of individual efforts. ¬†My goal with this site is to support you in doing just that: making big change on an individual level.

Following are _a whole_¬†_lot_ of individual efforts you can make today that will be significant steps toward that biggest scale change we need for a socially just tomorrow.
