I had lunch with a friend this week, and our conversation hit a peculiar roadblock: A lot of people are saying the same words &#8212; &#8220;social justice&#8221; &#8212; but meaning different things. This is a problem.

When you say &#8220;social justice,&#8221; what kind of justice are you talking about?<!--more-->

[<img class="size-full wp-image-3412 alignnone lazy-load" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inigo-keep-using-that-word.gif" alt="Inigo Montoya, from Princess Bride, saying 'you keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means." width="500" height="281" />][1]
  
Maybe you&#8217;re talking about **[retributive][2] social justice**. You might think of this as the [eye-for-an-eye][3], _just desserts_ form of social justice.

Or perhaps you mean something more like **[restorative][4] social justice**, where the wronged and wrong-doers come together in conversation to establish a remedial path forward.

In both cases, you&#8217;d be viewing justice through a punitive lens. Maybe that&#8217;s not your lens.

You might be talking about **legal social justice**, with the goal of equal representation and recognition under the law.

Or **[distributive][5] social justice**, where the aim is for everyone to have an equal share of societal resources. The focus here being on outcome. Alternatively, you could care more about process.

That would be **[procedural][6] social justice**, reworking society so everyone has a fair chance at those resources.

Now, these distinctions matter. I&#8217;m not just nit-picking. Because the [&#8220;What&#8221; inevitably leads to corresponding &#8220;How&#8221;s.][7]

For example, if you mean **retributive social justice**, the &#8220;How&#8221; might be:

  * Punishing people who were/are privileged or socially advantaged; and
  * Rewarding people who were/are oppressed or socially marginalized.

The distinctions also matter on the other side of the conversation. Someone might be arguing _against_ something you&#8217;re not arguing _for_.

If you&#8217;re just here for the argument, but don&#8217;t care about the outcome, I&#8217;d call that **[rhetorical][8] social justice.**

Or maybe you&#8217;re not thinking about arguments, outcomes, &#8220;How&#8221;s, or any of the above &#8212; you&#8217;re just saying what you&#8217;ve been told to say: **[dogmatic][9] social justice**.

In any case, it&#8217;s obvious we need to start saying what we mean, and being clear about not just what we&#8217;re reacting against, but what we&#8217;re standing for.
