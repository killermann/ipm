I&#8217;ve said it myself. I&#8217;ve read it a hundred times. You&#8217;ve probably heard it, or said it yourself. It usually goes something like, &#8220;We&#8217;re not asking you to give up your privileges. We&#8217;re trying to grant access to others who don&#8217;t have them.&#8221;

Or a pie analogy: &#8220;Privilege isn&#8217;t like pie. You don&#8217;t have to give up your slice for others to enjoy it.&#8221;

**The idea behind these sentiments is that the goal of [social justice][1] is not to take privileges away** from the &#8220;privileged&#8221; and give them to the &#8220;oppressed&#8221; ([an unhelpful binary][2]). 

When we [list privileges][3] (e.g., [male privileges][4], [cisgender privileges][5], [Christian privileges][6]) and ask people to &#8220;check their privilege,&#8221; we say we&#8217;re not asking them to give anything up. 

**Instead, we say that the goal is for _everyone_ to have access to those privileges.**

We say this, usually, as a defense to [privileged] people pushing back against our goals.

**And it&#8217;s a lie. A well-intentioned lie, but a lie nonetheless.**

<!--more-->

To oversimplify, privilege shows up in two ways: ways society is organized to _give you advantages_, and ways _you aren&#8217;t penalized_ for who you are.

Everything that falls into the first bucket only exists in contrast to not having it.

If white-ness is how you got your job, or male-ness is why your opinion is received as fact, or straight-ness is why your parental fitness is unquestioned, then a socially just world is one where your job, opinion, parenthood, and more aren&#8217;t granted based on those identities. Where your advantage is taken away.

Is that equity? And justice? And [a world I want to build][7]? Absolutely.

But it&#8217;s also one where a lot of people no longer hold privileges they currently do. We need to be honest about that.
