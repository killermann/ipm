[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1137 lazy-load" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/growing-pains1.jpg" alt="growing-pains" width="400" height="275" data-srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/growing-pains1.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/03/growing-pains1-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />][1]If you haven&#8217;t heard, Kirk Cameron, teenage heartthrob and man-boy perm enthusiast from the late 80s TV series _Growing Pains_, made tremors when he said homosexuality is &#8220;unnatural&#8221; and that it&#8217;s &#8220;detrimental and ultimately destructive to so many of the foundations of civilization.&#8221;

Let&#8217;s make this quick.

Homosexuality is quite natural, at least if one defines &#8220;natural&#8221; as existing in or formed by nature (the way the <a title="Dictionary.com" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/natural?r=75&src=ref&ch=dic" target="_blank">dictionary</a> does).  We all know people can be gay.  Some people argue they aren&#8217;t born that way, they&#8217;re wrong, just ask Gaga &#8211; but that&#8217;s another convo for another day.  The issue here is that homosexuality goes further than people.  Did you know that homosexuality exists in animals?  And I&#8217;m not just talking about dolphins (sorry, <a title="Brittany S Pierce from Glee" href="http://www.screened.com/brittany-s-pierce/15-3365/quotes/" target="_blank">Brittany</a>).

nd skinny jeans, how can you reconcile gay lions and tigers and bears?

Oh my.  You can&#8217;t?

If you believe that God created man in his image, that&#8217;s your prerogative.  You may also believe god created animals as they are now.  Fine.  But if that&#8217;s all true, you should also realize that **God created gay**.  And it&#8217;s not a good Christian who challenges the divine plan, is it?

Don&#8217;t worry, Kurt, we all still have a lot of growing up to do.

**Update: a wonderful person pointed out this hilarious video reaction to Kirk.  I felt compelled to share.**
