He&#8217;s since backtracked a lot, and wishy-washied, and etc.  But it&#8217;s as apparent how he truly feels as it is how bad he is at playing politics.

Dear Bradlee,

I heard about the whole Rachel Maddow thing.  Bummer.  Here&#8217;s the deal: the context, the specific wordings, the supposed omissions &#8212; they don&#8217;t matter.  You think homosexuality is a sin, and whether or not you want gay people dead (you do), you&#8217;re already mislead.  Allow me to set you _straight_.

{{< heyheylook >}}

oh &#8212; execution time, buddy (Genesis 38:9-10).  But I bet you&#8217;re not even worried about that (they&#8217;re just words, right?).  Fire away!

No, if I had to guess, I&#8217;d pin you down as a &#8220;Sodomite&#8221; guy.  I mean to say I bet that&#8217;s the story you draw from when you preach the anti-gay Gospel.  Sorry if you misunderstood.  Is that it?  That&#8217;s fair.  It&#8217;s both a fun word (sometimes I yell it like Gandalf: &#8220;You shall not SODOMIZE&#8221;), and a commonly misunderstood story.  I&#8217;m sure you know it (you&#8217;ve read the Bible, right?), but I&#8217;ll synopsize just in case.

The people of Sodom are being hardcore sinners.  God decides to give them one last chance.  Sends in a couple of undercover angels (not Cam, Drew, or Lucy &#8212; first mistake) to look for just 10 righteous people in the city.  If they find them, God will give the city a pass.  The angels are taken in for some old-fashioned hospitality by a cool dude named Lot, but the rest of men in the city aren&#8217;t happy about the strangers.  They gather around Lot&#8217;s house and demand he send the angels out so they may &#8220;know&#8221; them.  &#8220;Know&#8221;, translated from the Hebrew word &#8220;Yada,&#8221; has been understood to mean &#8220;violently gang rape to death.&#8221;  God wasn&#8217;t happy with what happened (obviously), so he destroyed the city.

Now, if you&#8217;re like other people I&#8217;ve talked to, you&#8217;ve somehow managed to convince yourself (and actually believe) that God was more concerned with the idea of a penis entering a man&#8217;s anus than the idea of an angry mob **violently murdering two innocent angels**.  Rape (man-on-man and man-on-woman) was a practiced form of degradation back then (still is); <a title="To Wikipedia!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JuicyCampus" target="_blank">JuicyCampus</a> hadn&#8217;t been invented yet.  What happened wasn&#8217;t motivated by gay (two people of the same sex who love one another), it was motivated by hate.

But that&#8217;s all Old Testament stuff, you&#8217;re right.  What did Jesus have to say about homosexuality?  That&#8217;ll really settle this.  Dude had a lot to say (and other dudes had a lot to say about him).  Surely the New Testament was ripe with &#8220;Jesus says burn the gays&#8221; imagery.

Sorry to disappoint you again, but that&#8217;s just not the case.  Jesus never mentions homosexuality.  He was more concerned with preaching that we should be compassionate, minimalistic, and kind.  Sorry, dude, looks like you&#8217;re out.

**In case you aren&#8217;t following, let me synopsize this all really quick for you.**  The Old Testament had a hardcore procreation slant.  All of the laws add up to say &#8220;don&#8217;t screw with your body, don&#8217;t screw with animals or dangerous stuff, just screw each other and make, like, so many babies.&#8221;  And the Jesus didn&#8217;t have an opinion on homosexuality one way or the other, but we can probably assume he wouldn&#8217;t be pro-mass-execution.

We have over 7 BILLION people on this planet.  Trust me, we don&#8217;t need to worry about procreating any more.  If God had known we&#8217;d be this good at doing each other, he probably wouldn&#8217;t have made it so fun.  Oh, perhaps he did know, and that&#8217;s why he gave us <a title="Grindr" href="http://grindr.com/" target="_blank">Grindr</a>.

It&#8217;s never too late to find Jesus.  If not, enjoy your sinnin&#8217;, brotha.

Peace,

Samuel

P.S. I didn&#8217;t mean to rub my fine Biblical name in your misspelled mid-19th century Old English name&#8217;s face.
