Gender isÂ a social construction.

Even if you take the most extremeÂ [biological determinist][1] stance (which a lot of the &#8220;gender isn&#8217;t a social construction&#8221; crowd take), you cannot deny the following:

  * What it means to be aÂ &#8220;woman&#8221; or &#8220;man&#8221; changes over time (often within the timeframe of a generation &#8212; ask your grandparents if you don&#8217;t believe me).
  * Further, right now, the traits associated with each of those roles are different in different parts of the world (watch a sitcom from another country if you don&#8217;t believe me).

If our understanding of gender changes faster than our biology could possibly evolve, and currently exists in many forms around the world reflecting cultural differences, it&#8217;s socially constructed. End of argument. That&#8217;s what those two words, combined,Â _mean._

**And gender is real.**

Just because something&#8217;s a social construction doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not real (despite many fellow &#8220;social construction&#8221; folks saying so).<!--more-->

The famous example: money. Nobody would argue that there is any _inherent_ value in the paper; we instead buy into the _idea_ that it&#8217;s valuable. Money is a social construction, and it&#8217;s very, very real. It&#8217;s life-or-death real (try living without it if you don&#8217;t believe me). Ditto for gender.

Gender is one of the few ways we still allow (actually,Â _encourage_) systemic, identity-based discrimination and segregation. It&#8217;s one of the fundamental ways we&#8217;re taught to see the world, and the world is taught to see us. It&#8217;s infused in our names and how we [talk about][2] others.

Now, is itÂ _based_ in biology? _Influenced_ by? Completely _unmoored_ from? That&#8217;s a different argument, and one we can&#8217;t get to until we stop conflating it with this one.

It&#8217;s like arguing about the [gold standard][3].

My take: gold&#8217;s intrinsic value is misconstrued. Read into that whatever you&#8217;d like. ðŸ˜‰
