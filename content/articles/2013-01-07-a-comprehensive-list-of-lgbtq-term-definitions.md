*This list is neither comprehensive nor inviolable, but it&#8217;s a work in progress toward those goals. With identity terms, trust the person who is using the term and their definition of it above any dictionary. These definitions are the creation of a cultural commons: emails, online discussions, and in-person chats, with the initial curation being mine, then growing into a collaboration between [Meg Bolger](https://megbolger.com) and me at&nbsp;[TheSafeZoneProject.com][1].

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are constantly&nbsp;honing and adjusting language to &#8212; our humble goal &#8212; have the definitions resonate with at least 51 out of 100 people who use the words.&nbsp;Identity terms are tricky, and trying to write a description that works <em>perfectly</em> for <em>everyone</em> using that label simply isn&#8217;t possible.</span>

Some definitions here may include words you aren&#8217;t familiar with, or have been taught a flawed or incomplete definition for; I&#8217;ve likely defined those words somewhere else in the list, but if I&nbsp;also missed many. This is an ever-evolving project that I do my best to check back in on every three or four months.&nbsp;All that said, let&#8217;s get started&#8230; alphabetically:
