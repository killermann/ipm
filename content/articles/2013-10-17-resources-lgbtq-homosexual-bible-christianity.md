Only a tiny, tiny part of the bible can even be argued to reference &#8220;homosexuality&#8221; (and that argument, in a few of the verses in particular, is worth looking into), yet it seems like whenever we hear about the Bible in the news it&#8217;s being slammed against LGBTQ equality. Even worse, kids are disowned and kicked out of Christian houses because of this .0002% of the bible.

In an effort to help one kid in need, I reached out to Facebook (<a title="Facebook Post" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=591894784207388&set=a.225685850828285.56078.216393541757516&type=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&#8217;s the post</a>) to collect as many great resources as possible for having a conversation tantamount to &#8220;Christian + Gay = Okay.&#8221; Below are those. 

Please reply to share more resources you&#8217;d recommend, and I&#8217;ll update this list periodically.
