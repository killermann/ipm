Gay isn&#8217;t a bad word, assuming you&#8217;re using it to describe a man who is attracted (physically, spiritually, and emotionally) to other men, (depending on label preference) a woman who is attracted to women, or anyone else who self-identifies as gay.  In that case, feel comfortable using the word gay.  But that&#8217;s the extent of it.

Gay has been turned into a bad word by people who have chosen to use it as an insult.  &#8220;Gay&#8221; is often used in exchange for &#8220;stupid&#8221;, &#8220;annoying&#8221;, &#8220;girly&#8221;, and &#8220;[any other negative word]&#8221;.  It&#8217;s become so common, in fact, that people will call something gay without even realizing the word is normally attached to sexuality, which is something a car, no matter how &#8220;gay&#8221; you might think it is, cannot be associated with.

A car can&#8217;t be gay.

The word gay has become so synonymous with _bad_ that people often feel uncomfortable using it correctly.  I&#8217;ve experience well-intentioned people stumbling over the word gay to describe someone who is actually gay, saying things like, &#8220;he&#8217;s ga&#8211;uh&#8230; homosexual.&#8221;  In this case, gay is the right word to use.  Homosexual is a medical term, and not one that creates comfort within the gay community.  It&#8217;s a problem when people struggle to use the correct word to describe something, because it&#8217;s become so slanted by people charging it with hate and ignorance.

What&#8217;s worse: the way many of us use the word &#8220;gay&#8221; has become damaging to LGBTQ people and straight people alike.  It&#8217;s an insult to call someone straight &#8220;gay&#8221;, and the fact that that&#8217;s an insult is incredibly harmful to people who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual.  The video of Jonah above is a great example of this.

New rule: if you&#8217;re talking about a dude who likes dudes (or, again, depending on preference, a gal who likes gals), use the word &#8220;gay&#8221;; if you&#8217;re not, don&#8217;t.  It&#8217;s that simple.  Good?  Good.

  Update! Here&#8217;s the thing, gang. A lot of groups I didn&#8217;t mention in this post also identify as &#8220;gay&#8221;. This includes (but is certainly not limited to) some women who love women, some trans-identified folks, some genderqueer folks, some agender folks, and more. It&#8217;s not a term limited strictly to men who are attracted to men, as it&#8217;s semantically defined. If this sounds overwhelming, it shouldn&#8217;t. If you&#8217;re not sure what to call someone, just follow the <a title="The Corruption of the Golden Rule" href="/2011/12/the-corruption-of-the-golden-rule/" target="_blank">platinum rule</a> and ask.
