Look around you. Â Every product, gadget, building, company &#8212; every _thing_ &#8212; was created by a person who is just like you or me or Uncle Jesse from Full House (kidding &#8212; _nobody_ is like Uncle Jesse). Â 

As you walk through your life, you&#8217;re surrounded by the accomplishments and influences of individuals of the past and present. Â You&#8217;re surrounded by a world _they_ built &#8212; for you, and everyone around you.

I, for one, am not entirely happy with the world that has been built for me. Â I want to live in a world that is socially just, where individuals all have the same access to the good stuff &#8212; education, jobs, swedish fish, etc. &#8212; regardless of the identities they do or do not possess. Â If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve likely thought, at some point, something along the lines ofÂ _I want to make this world a better place to live in_.

Last week I made a <a title="How to respond when someone uses non-inclusive (or bigoted) language" href="/2012/06/how-to-respond-to-non-inclusive-language-or-bigoted-speec/" target="_blank">comic explaining how to respond to bigoted language</a>. Â When I posted it on <a title="To Facebook!" href="http://facebook.com/metrosam" target="_blank">our Facebook page</a>, a fan, Eric, asked how to respond &#8220;when someone uses non-inclusive or bigoted language online in video games?&#8221; Â What he was referring to was the rampant use of slurs (homophobic, racist, and otherwise) in online multiplayer games &#8212; something anyone who plays can attest to.

My response, abridged, was &#8220;that bothers me, too, but it&#8217;s not gonna change unless someone does something about it&#8221; (I may have thrown a &#8220;dude&#8221; in there). Â The &#8220;someone&#8221; I was referring to was someone who _is more famous than me, has more money than me,_ or _has more time/energy than I do. Â _Truly, it was anyone _but_ me.

A few hours later I realized how flippantly I dismissed his question and the idea. Â I&#8217;m happy I caught myself, because I realized that this was not only something I want to change, but also something that is within my scope of abilities and talents to change, and that I shouldn&#8217;t just pass it off &#8220;someone&#8221; to do when I can be that &#8220;someone.&#8221;

So I spent the next day developing what becameÂ **<a title="Gamers Against Bigotry" href="http://gamersagainstbigotry.org" target="_blank">Gamers Against Bigotry</a>**, which is an org centered around a pledge gamers can sign stating that they will not use bigoted language of any type. Â Maybe it&#8217;ll help contribute to the solution of the problem, and maybe it won&#8217;t, but at least it has a shot now that it&#8217;s a _thing_, and not just a &#8220;what if.&#8221;

## Why am I telling you this?

I&#8217;m telling you all of this for a few reasons:

**1. I want you to encourage you to build your own world**, to not take what was given to you as absolute, and move and shake and dream and create the world you think ought to be.

**2. I want you to be extra aware of the _qualifier trap_ that we all fall into**, in hopes that you can prevent yourself from falling in and never getting out. Â I know you want to make a positive impression on this world before you leave &#8212; you wouldn&#8217;t visiting my site if you didn&#8217;t.

**3. I want to remind you that youÂ _can_ make the difference you want to make**, but only if you&#8217;re willing to put yourself out there and try. Â Atwood (one of my fav authors) wrote, &#8220;Thrown over a precipice, you fall or else you fly.&#8221; Â A lot of us are so sure we&#8217;ll fall we never try to fly.

1. **I want you to <a title="To the Pledge" href="http://gamersagainstbigotry.org/signatures" target="_blank">sign the pledge to end bigotry in gaming</a>**, though it&#8217;s mostly the first three&#8211; let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; this one would also be nice ðŸ™‚

There are so many elegant quotes I could end this with. Â Ghandi <a title="Or maybe he didn't" href="http://www.elephantjournal.com/2011/08/be-the-change-you-wish-to-see-in-the-world-not-gandhi/" target="_blank">allegedly</a> said &#8220;Be the change you wish to see in the world,&#8221; Ray Davis said, &#8220;Status quos are meant to be broken,&#8221; and Ernie said &#8220;When I squeeze you, you make noise,&#8221; which could have been about his rubber ducky, or it could be a metaphor describing the relationship between cause and effect in social change.
