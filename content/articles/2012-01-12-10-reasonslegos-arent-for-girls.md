  <strong>Update:</strong>Â check out this <a title="Little girl goes on a rant over pink toys [VIDEO]" href="/2012/01/little-girl-goes-on-a-rant-over-pink-toys-video/">video of a little girl explaining her frustration with gendered toys</a>.
</address>

It&#8217;s amazing how gendered toys are. Â If you see an action figure, you think _boy_. Â If you see a barbie, you think _girl_. Â If you see a boy with a barbie, you think _gay_. Â And now LEGO is saying if you see LEGOs, you should think _boy &#8211;Â _that is, unless it&#8217;s a LadyFigs LEGO set (pictured below), then you should think _girl girl girl._

In releasing the LadyFigs and beginning a &#8220;LEGO for Girls&#8221; (my name, not theirs) ad campaign, LEGO has stated that they want to open up the product to the other 50% of the world. Â Hey, LEGO, in case you didn&#8217;t know, your products have always been open to 100% of the population &#8211; the same 100% of the population you&#8217;re now alienating by taking such a 60s approach to reinforcing stale, unhealthy gender roles.

**Update:** When I wrote this article, a petition was active on <a title="Change.org" href="http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-lego-to-stop-selling-out-girls-liberatelegos" target="_blank">Change.org</a>. Â Part of my goal in writing it was to help convince folks to sign the petition using my top 10 frustrations with this campaign:

**10. The LEGO set in the picture is barely even a LEGO set, and more of a dollhouse. Â **Are girls not able to piece LEGOs together themselves to make create a gender-stereotypical box in which they can mold themselves?

**9. Diamonds? Â Seriously?!**Â  The hairbrush is one thing, LEGO, but diamonds the size of ostrich eggs? Â I think that&#8217;s one step too far. Â The girl is seven. Â I think the purse is already pushing it.

**8. Is that a diary on her bed? Â **Oh wait, let me guess: there is another set with a kitchen theme and it comes with a cookbook.

**7. There are plenty of gender assignments subliminally attached to toys, we don&#8217;t need overt ones.** Â LEGO going out of their way to say &#8220;these are for girls&#8221; means they aren&#8217;t for boys, and traditional LEGOs (AKA fun LEGOs) aren&#8217;t for girls.

**6. LEGO is a powerful, trend-setting company; we don&#8217;t need trends that reverse progress.** Â What if other toy companies did the same thing? Â <a title="Creepy Crawlers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creepy_Crawlers" target="_blank">Ohwait</a>.

**5. Diamonds? Seriously, seriously?! Â **I can&#8217;t get over that. Â Are those actually mock diamonds? Â I really want to punch my computer screen in the face.

**4. Girls don&#8217;t need LEGO telling them they aren&#8217;t as creative or ingenuitive as boys. Â **They already hear that every day from television, their teachers, and, in sad cases, their parents.

**3. Boys don&#8217;t need LEGO telling them they need to be more creative and ingenuitive than girls. Â **What if a boy wants to sit in front of a mirror, surrounded by diamonds, and brush his hair? Â LEGO says, &#8220;no, sir.&#8221;

**2. Toys should be marketed to kids, not boys or girls.**Â  Guess what, if you do this well, you&#8217;ll have twice (that&#8217;s 200%) the effective audience for your ads, AND you won&#8217;t be subliminally restricting children&#8217;s futures. Â Win win.

**1. Why do the girls get all the pretty colors? Â **Yeah, why?
