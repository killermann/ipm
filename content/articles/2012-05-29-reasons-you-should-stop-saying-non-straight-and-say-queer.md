excerpt: The term "non-straight" is not a more inclusive, more "PC", or in any way a better alternative to "gay", "lesbian", "bisexual", or "pansexual"

With all the talk of <a title="Same-sex marriage opinions not reflected in votes" href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jJxvV4Zf2bjFKulWJFJbzIayelkw?docId=63af4efb5d434e8e9f481348391668fd" target="_blank">marriage equality</a>, <a title="Gay Xmen Wedding" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/marvel-comics-hosts-first-gay-wedding-in-astonishing-x-men-20120522" target="_blank">gay comic book weddings</a>, and <a title="Even better flowchart: when it‚Äôs okay to say ‚Äúgay‚Äù" href="/2012/04/even-better-flowchart-when-its-okay-to-say-gay/" target="_blank">even gayer flowcharts</a> flowing around the web, people are getting ever more sensitive about using inclusive language when they can.

**That&#8217;s great!**¬† But more often than ever I am hearing folks use the term &#8220;non-straight&#8221; to refer to people who are lesbian, gay, bi-, pan- or even trans*. ¬†That&#8217;s not so great.

(Psst&#8230; you can also replace &#8220;non-straight&#8221; with &#8220;non-white&#8221; or other &#8220;non-[insert dominant group here]&#8221; labels people often use)

### 1. &#8220;Non-straight&#8221; creates two possible identities: straight and other

Most people take at least a bit of pride in their sexuality, so why rob them of that by describing their identity as not the dominant one? ¬†My little brother&#8217;s name is Zak and I can tell you with absolute certainty it would bum him out if people started calling him &#8220;Non-Sam&#8221; because he came second and happens to be smaller. ¬†Sure, he technically is &#8220;non-Sam,&#8221; but he&#8217;s also a helluva lot more &#8220;Zak.&#8221;

### 2. &#8220;Non-straight&#8221; makes queer seem even queerer

The term &#8220;non-straight&#8221; is one I would refer to as &#8220;reinforcing heteronormativity.&#8221; ¬†Another way of putting that is that when people say &#8220;non-straight&#8221; they are establishing that straight is normal and everything else is abnormal. ¬†Sheer numbers, popular media, and major religious organizations do enough to marginalize diversity of sexuality, we don&#8217;t need to add to that.

### 3. &#8220;Non-straight&#8221; is sexuality specific, ignoring trans* folks altogether

Most of the time when I&#8217;ve heard people use the term &#8220;non-straight&#8221; they are referring to the queer community as a whole, which includes sexual identities and gender identities. ¬†Being a genderqueer or transgender person is unrelated to sexuality (read more about <a title="Sexual Orientation for the Genderqueer Person" href="/2012/02/sexual-orientation-for-the-genderqueer/" target="_blank">sexual orientation for a genderqueer person</a>) &#8212; it&#8217;s a gender thing, which is different.

### 4. &#8220;Non-straight&#8221; is occasionally confusingly broad

Unlike in the last point, I have also heard people say their friend is &#8220;non-straight&#8221; instead of using the term &#8220;gay&#8221; or &#8220;lesbian&#8221; (or whatever their friend might be). ¬†If your friend identifies as [IDENTITY], then you should identify them by calling them [IDENTITY]. ¬†&#8220;Gay&#8221; isn&#8217;t a bad word to call someone if that someone is gay, but it&#8217;s turned into a bad word because (as I <a title="I want to say gay Kickstarter" href="http://kck.st/J5gVuO" target="_blank">hear myself saying</a> a lot these days) most people are just using it wrong.

## So what should I say instead?

If you are talking about an individual, use the term that individual uses to self-identify. ¬†If you&#8217;re talking about a group (e.g., &#8220;gay men&#8221;) use the label the group uses. ¬†And if you&#8217;re just plain unsure, or are talking about the LGBTQQPIAA+ community as a whole, fall back on one of many broad options: &#8220;the LGBTQ community,&#8221; &#8220;the GSM community,&#8221; &#8220;LGBT people,&#8221; &#8220;people who are queer,&#8221; &#8220;the queer community,&#8221; or &#8220;queer folks.&#8221;

  *<strong>A quick note</strong>: as with any &#8220;rule&#8221; this one isn&#8217;t perfect. Many individuals and some groups (e.g., many people of color) may not identify with the term &#8220;queer.&#8221; ¬†While it&#8217;s a good start (and better than &#8220;non-straight&#8221;), when in doubt fall back on the <a title="The Corruption of the Golden Rule" href="/2011/12/the-corruption-of-the-golden-rule/" target="_blank">platinum rule</a>.
