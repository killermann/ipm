Hello, Toyota.

<a title="EricTeske Twitter Account" href="http://twitter.com/ericteske" target="_blank">@EricTeske</a> pointed out the Super Bowl ad below, with the following comment:

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-931 lazy-load" title="ericteske-tweet" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ericteske-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="556" height="196" data-srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ericteske-tweet.jpg 556w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ericteske-tweet-300x105.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" />][1]

The add features a decidedly gay-friendly moment, and we&#8217;re not talking about the Lionel Richie (he&#8217;s straight, folks).  About 8 seconds in a man is presented with options for a super-hot near-naked ladies couch, or a super-hot near-naked dudes couch.  And he seems to be more interested in the prospect of resting his butter bumps atop a smattering of hyper-manly beefcakes.

Read enough of my jibberish yet?  Watch the video and let us know what you think about it in the comments below.

As was just pointed out <a title="On Facebook!" href="http://facebook.com/metrosam" target="_blank">on facebook</a>, if you saw this commercial and didn&#8217;t notice the gay-friendly sentiment, that&#8217;s a good thing.  Being able to have a commercial like this without it being labeled explicitly &#8220;pro-gay&#8221; means gay is becoming more &#8220;normal.&#8221;  Just as <a title="To Wikipedia!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronormativity" target="_blank">heteronormativity</a> is subtly reinforced (see: every other Super Bowl ad), it&#8217;s progress when an lgbt-friendly message can be just as subtle.

Or, as Eric continued in the comments below, &#8220;Just think, his little smirk in approval of a male-beefcake-couch was seen by millions of Super Bowl viewers! This shallow but broad engagement of mass media consumers does a lot to normalize the idea of men who are attracted to men.&#8221;

Thanks for the sharp eye and keen insights, Eric!
