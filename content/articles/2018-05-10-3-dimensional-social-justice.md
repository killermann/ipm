Despite a tidal wave of awareness of social justice issues (or maybe because of it), a lot of conversations are getting stuck. Some people are becoming increasingly &#8220;anti social justice.&#8221; And we seem to be circling loops that go back decades.

Recently, I&#8217;ve been wondering: How might we break the loops? How might we respond to people who criticize social justice movements? How might we take steps toward this ultimate goal of &#8220;social justice&#8221;? (That is what it is, right? A goal?)

**3-Dimensional Social Justice** is what came to my mind. **My theory is that we&#8217;ll be more successful if we include (at least) 3 dimensions in our social justice arguments.**

As for what those dimensions are, or how we incorporate them, I have tons of ideas. For example, let&#8217;s start with these three: efficacy, scale, time.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3325 lazy-load" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-dimensional-social-justice-efficacy-scale-time.jpg" alt="Image showing three dimensions of social justice: efficacy, scale, and time" width="1200" height="630" data-srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-dimensional-social-justice-efficacy-scale-time.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-dimensional-social-justice-efficacy-scale-time-300x158.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-dimensional-social-justice-efficacy-scale-time-768x403.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-dimensional-social-justice-efficacy-scale-time-1024x538.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />

With any social justice intervention, we might consider the following questions:

  1. Will this produce the desired effect? (Efficacy)
  2. Can we apply this to society-at-large? (Scale)
  3. What will the future look like with this implemented? (Time)

Or maybe it&#8217;s more helpful in a given situation to consider multiple dimensions within a concept:

  * Efficacy: goal, theory, implementation
  * Scale: individual, societal, global
  * Time: past, present, future

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3329 lazy-load" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-dimensional-social-justice-efficacy-scale-time-layers.jpg" alt="All three dimensions broken into three dimensions (efficacy: goal, theory, implementation; scale: individual, societal, global; time: past, present, future)" width="1200" height="630" data-srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-dimensional-social-justice-efficacy-scale-time-layers.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-dimensional-social-justice-efficacy-scale-time-layers-300x158.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-dimensional-social-justice-efficacy-scale-time-layers-768x403.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-dimensional-social-justice-efficacy-scale-time-layers-1024x538.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />

With these dimensions in mind, if someone is critical of a social justice, we can investigate which part they&#8217;re resisting (is it the _goal?_ Or something else?).

Or maybe we consider how each of the dimensions of efficacy pass or don&#8217;t pass the scale or time tests, and mash the two above concepts together.

If this is starting to sound like a Rubik&#8217;s Cube, I think that&#8217;s apt: none of this is simple, and any square not in alignment is actively impeding our goal.

Maybe 3DSJ is just about having more social justice arguments in _literal_ 3-dimensional space. In-person. [Meatspace.][1]

For me, it&#8217;s apples and oranges doing [social justice education][2] on the internet vs. in-person &#8212; and the apples are the poisonous variety.
