Let&#8217;s say a friend of yours made a New Year&#8217;s resolution to stop being on their phone during dinner. It&#8217;s January 4th, you&#8217;re sharing a table, and you catch them peeping their insta. You call them on it, they apologize, and put their phone away.

Hypocrisy, meet behavior. Behavior, meet change. _Huzzah!_

That&#8217;s how calling someone out on their hypocrisy _works_. There are a few important factors here:

  1. The person you&#8217;re calling out has stated (or otherwise believes) that they want to walk a particular (moral) path: **&#8220;From&nbsp;now&nbsp;on,&nbsp;I&#8217;m&nbsp;going&nbsp;to&nbsp;do X.&#8221;**
  2. You notice their actions are contrary to that, and actively getting in the way of them living that espoused value, or walking their talk.
  3. You point out this gap: &#8220;**You said you were going to do X, but now you&#8217;re doing Anti-X.&#8221;**
  4. This prompts [cognitive dissonance][1], and they have to pick a path: do as they said they&#8217;d do, or give up on that moral stance.

Each one of those four steps is necessary. They work as a chain reaction.

## Welcome to Hypocrisy Theatre: Where Social Media is Our Stage and Our Audience is Only People Who Already Agree With Us

For several years now, there&#8217;s been a new show in town: Hypocrisy Theatre. And unlike the example above, Hypocrisy Theatre isn&#8217;t effective in changing the hypocrite&#8217;s behavior. Indeed, they&#8217;re not even part of the audience. 

Maybe you&#8217;ve caught a performance of it?

The cast changes daily, but the show always follows the same script: some random person on social media points out that some other random person they disagree with once said something that flies in the face of a thing they&#8217;re saying now.

It often looks like this:

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter"><img data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hypocrisy-theatre-tweet-cropped.png" alt="A mock-up of a tweet showing one person calling out another person by citing messages from their past" class="wp-image-3467 lazy-load" data-srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hypocrisy-theatre-tweet-cropped.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hypocrisy-theatre-tweet-cropped-300x179.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hypocrisy-theatre-tweet-cropped-768x458.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>
</div>

(I&#8217;m keeping this vague, instead of citing any of the 10 examples I just saw in [my Twitter][2], because I&#8217;m doing my best not to publicly drag people here. But you can fill in the blanks. Or just scroll your social feeds &#8212; I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;ll catch a showing in the wild.)

Hypocrisy, meet behavior. Behavior, meet continuing on the same path unabated. _Huz oh no._

That&#8217;s now how this is supposed to work.

## Why This Doesn&#8217;t Work

Hypocrisy Theatre, at face value, is similar to the Phone-at-the-Table Example above, but it never plays out that way.

There are a load of reasons why. 

First, I want to point out how these examples are different, then it&#8217;ll be more obvious why Hypocrisy Theatre doesn&#8217;t work.

In the Phone-at-the-Table Example, you:

  * Personally knew the person you were calling out;
  * Recognized that their behavior was directly antithetical to _their&nbsp;goals_. 
  * Called _them&nbsp;out_, with a message that was directed at them, and explicitly _for&nbsp;their&nbsp;benefit_. You wanted to help them line up their values and actions.
  * And your message invoked cognitive dissonance: it made them see that they weren&#8217;t walking their talk, because they sincerely weren&#8217;t.

None of those are necessarily true for Hypocrisy Theatre. 

Instead, generally speaking, in Hypocrisy Theatre, you:

  * Don&#8217;t know the person you&#8217;re calling out;
  * Recognize that their behavior is directly antithetical to _your&nbsp;goals_.
  * Call them out _to&nbsp;your&nbsp;people_, with a message that benefits you (by raising your status, or making you A Good One) or your cause. You don&#8217;t care if they align their values and actions.
  * And your message doesn&#8217;t invoke cognitive dissonance in the mind of the hypocrite (if they even received the message), but instead invokes outrage or disgust or galvanizes a &#8220;that person sucks&#8221; feeling within your circle.

Maybe that lines up for you? Maybe you&#8217;ve seen examples of this in your social media feeds? Maybe you&#8217;ve participated in it? I can, unfortunately, say &#8220;Aye&#8221; to all three.

Some of those might be negotiable.

It might work well to call out strangers, or with a paper-thin artifice of it being about &#8220;their goals,&#8221; or to do so publicly (messaging to your audience primarily, instead of them) &#8212; all of those things _might_ work.

It depends on the situation.

But there&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s an absolute dealbreaker, and separates Hypocrisy Theatre from the real thing.

## The cognitive dissonance comes from someone recognizing their actions aren&#8217;t lining up with their values. 

Cognitive dissonance is a necessary ingredient in changing behavior by pointing out hypocrisy, and its totally absent from Hypocrisy Theatre.

For a lot of the people foisted on stage and cast in the role of &#8220;Hypocrite,&#8221; they never experience cognitive dissonance. Here are two reasons.

One, we&#8217;re often contrasting an X with a Y, instead of an Anti-X. They might be connected for us, but completely unrelated to &#8220;The Hypocrite.&#8221;

For example, let&#8217;s say someone said &#8220;Climate change is a problem we should all take steps to solve&#8221; (X) and later we found out they ate meat (Y). _Ah-ha! Hypocrisy,&nbsp;thy&nbsp;name&nbsp;is&nbsp;you_! We could call them out on that, and have them be completely dumbfounded, because they never read [that article][3]. For them, X ? Y.

Okay, but what about when we really do line up an X with a sincere Anti-X? That has to work, even in Hypocrisy Theatre, right?

Well, also no. Or, at least, often no.

Because, two, they might have a deeper value, or one that supersedes whatever we&#8217;re poking at, that rationally explains what they were doing/saying.

It&#8217;s not hypocritical if they are acting in accordance with a higher value.

And with Hypocrisy Theatre, we don&#8217;t know that, we often don&#8217;t make an effort to find that out, and we simply don&#8217;t care if someone tells us it&#8217;s true.

On the other hand, if Friend-Who-Texts-At-Dinner told us they were checking their phone because their dog was at the vet undergoing an operation, and they are awaiting updates, we&#8217;d probably give them a hypocrisy pass.

You better. Or I&#8217;ll bite you.

## Then Why Do So Many Of Us Do It?

If it doesn&#8217;t work, why are so many people doing it, all the time?

And why am I constantly feeling the urge to do it, too? To put on a little showing of Hypocrisy Theatre in my Facebook feed.

{{< heyheylook >}}


  * It makes us feel good, right, better, smarter, truer, morally superior &#8212; as compared to &#8220;them&#8221; (whoever isn&#8217;t us);
  * We get rewarded for doing it Right with likes, and follows, and clicks, and other things that are hard to distinguish from progress or growth; and
  * It obfuscates our real goal, tricking us into thinking that pointing out other people&#8217;s bad is the same as doing good.

Now, it&#8217;s at this point that I want to call your attention to something that might not have been obvious: so far, I&#8217;ve presented all of this as ideologically neutral.

That is, there isn&#8217;t a particular ideology, belief set, political faction, or mindset that participates in Hypocrisy Theatre. It&#8217;s a show for everyone, like _Wicked_.

Because of this, a lot of us doing simply because other people in our circles are doing it.

We&#8217;re not thinking about the overall goals of our work, life, or actions. 

We&#8217;re not thinking about effecting the change we believe is possible in our hearts. 

We&#8217;re not really thinking at all, besides, maybe, &#8220;What&#8217;s the harm?&#8221;

## What&#8217;s the Harm?

Hypocrisy Theatre reduces complicated, multi-dimensional, intersectional, and nuanced viewpoints into two-sentence hot takes.

It motivates us to seek the approval of people who already agree with us, at the expense of everyone else. The likes. The retweets. _&#8220;If you&#8217;re getting hated on, you must be doing something right.&#8221;_

It tells us that it&#8217;s okay to think for someone else, to ignore their values, and to dismiss them altogether. _&#8220;We don&#8217;t need them, we have us.&#8221;_

It lulls us away from whatever our goals are, or figuring out the actions that could line up with _our_ values, because it&#8217;s far more comfortable, easy, and safe to just point out what others are doing wrong, than it is to create something right. _&#8220;They&#8217;re&nbsp;so&nbsp;backwards lol.&#8221;_

Hypocrisy Theatre is also everywhere, all the time, playing in every town and social media profile, and it&#8217;s so easy to catch a show and the cast changes so often that it&#8217;s become hard to _really_ care about it any more. Like _Wicked_.

_And no one mourns the Wicked._
