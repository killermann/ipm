<img class=" wp-image-1019 alignleft lazy-load" title="Donate $24" alt="" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/donate-24-plus.jpg" width="200" height="200" data-srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/donate-24-plus.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/02/donate-24-plus-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/02/donate-24-plus.jpg 125w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />A kitten?  I suppose you could ask for a kitten.  But no kittens.

For those of you uninitiated, _It&#8217;s Pronounced Metrosexual_ is a one-person operation.  I ([Sam][1]) build/maintain the site, write the articles (guest authors coming soon!), and perform the live show at colleges around the US.  The Google ads on the side are a new addition and &#8211; I&#8217;m learning &#8211; are largely ornamental.  My readers aren&#8217;t suckers.

A while back I made a sweet design that&#8217;s available free as a [printable .pdf and jpg][2], and plenty of people said they wanted it as a T-Shirt.  Well, now it&#8217;s officially available as a t-shirt.  If you donate more than $24 to _It&#8217;s Pronounced Metrosexual_, you get a shirt.  It&#8217;s as simple as that.

Where does money from donations go, you might ask?  Allow me to answer!

## The Donation Breakdown

The shortest way of explaining where donations go is this: all money we receive goes to promoting _It&#8217;s Pronounced Metrosexual_ and keeping it afloat.  If you want it more clearly spelled out, I&#8217;ve created this fun list to give you an idea of how a __ dollar donation could be utilized.

**$1 &#8211; **pays for one promotional postcard printed and mailed to a school to encourage them to book the show

**$5 &#8211;** buy Sam lunch and keep his email-/article-/comment-writing fingers energized

**$10 &#8211;** prints 100 <a title="Edugraphics" href="/category/edugraphics/" target="_blank">edugraphics</a> to be distributed to students during a live performance at a school

**$25 &#8211;** help buy a couple T-shirts we use as thank yous for $24+ donations

**$50 &#8211; **Facebook advertisement campaign to introduce a helpful article to >50,000 people who haven&#8217;t seen it

**$100 &#8211;** initial advertising campaign to get IPM into areas other than colleges (e.g., high schools, military)

**$500 &#8211; **buys a plane ticket to allow Sam to perform the show to a high school with no budget for diversity programming

**$1000** &#8211; sponsor a college show and get IPM to a campus that can&#8217;t afford the full production costs
