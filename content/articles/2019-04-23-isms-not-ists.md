To achieve the goals of [social justice][1], we need to reform society at the system level. We need to dismantle rac_ism_, sex_ism_, cissex_ism_, heterosex_ism_, gender_ism_, able_ism_, class_ism_, and more.

Too much of social justice discourse and calls-to-action are focused on the _-ists_, the people participating in (and perpetuating) those systems.

**Our focus on individual actors keeps increasing in social justice spaces** I occupy. It’s almost all of what I notice in online social justice activism/advocacy. I’m guessing you’ve noticed it, too.

This focus often takes the form of [punitive social justice][2], identifying perpetrators, dragging them, publicly shaming them, “canceling” them.

We also see it in listicles with titles that highlight the # Ways You’re Part of the Problem. Or the inverse: # Ways to Be Part of the Solution.

We experience it in workshops with activities designed to highlight individuals&#8217; [privilege][3] or contributions to oppression. 

Every time a finger gets pointed at **a person** — whether they’re a Fortune 500 CEO or a high school student — we’re focusing on an _-ist_.

We do it because it feels good, or tangible, or even just doable. It’s something that’s within our power. The system seems out of reach.

Every campaign to “cancel” an _-ist_ — whether successful or not — isn’t the same as addressing the system. It brings our attention _away_ from the system and toward an individual within it.

It&#8217;s the _-ism_ that created the conditions where that person&#8217;s behavior seemed right, celebrated, or like the only path they could walk, but instead of addressing that, we scapegoat the _-ist_. A ceremonial sacrifice that opens up a vacancy the machine will dutifully fill with a replacement who can perform the role.

The system is unscathed, and potentially strengthened: the next person won&#8217;t make that same misstep, better concealing the machinations of the _-ism_.

Do we need to focus on _-ists_, to some extent, in the pursuit of social justice? To hold people accountable, transform them, foster growth?

Maybe. I don’t know. I certainly know that I’m not saying — here, now — that we never should, or that we never need to.

**What I’m saying is that focusing on** _**-ists**_ **will never be sufficient. That it’s energy we’re directing toward a symptom, not a cause.**

And that if we don’t do it carefully, it’s likely to create more problems than solutions.

It already is.
