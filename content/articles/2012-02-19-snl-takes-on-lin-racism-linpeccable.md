If you&#8217;re like me and don&#8217;t _do_ sports, you might need the inside info to make this joke funny.  Spark notes version: Jeremy Lin was a super underdog basketball player from Harvard who recently had his first start with the New York Knicks and has scored more points in his first five starts than any modern b-baller.

Anyway, the response has been overwhelmingly punny, coined _Linsanity_.  But it&#8217;s also opened the doors for a lot of borderline and way-past-the-line racist remarks.  SNL does a great job with the satire, as they often do.  Enjoy!
