New year, new site.

I spent the past couple weeks rebuilding this site top-to-bottom with two goals in mind: make it faster and make it more accessible. It&#8217;s coming in at over 70% faster than the old site, and <del datetime="2018-01-30T15:05:49+00:00">I haven&#8217;t even</del> [now I&#8217;ve switched to new hosting][1] ([Want to help pay for it?][2]), the primary reason for this rebuild.

And with all those upsides come a whole lot of potential bugs. If you&#8217;re up for it, I&#8217;d love your help squashingÂ them (non-violently, of course). If you notice something on the site that seems off, let me know.

Twitter ([@Killermann][3]) is best for me if it works for you, but you can also email (sam@0afb8f23-e02f-4bd2-a9ce-bafa1dce6d8c.app.getshifter.io). All I&#8217;ll need from you is a screenshot of the bug, or a brief description, along with two important things: what browser you are using (e.g., &#8220;Chrome&#8221;), and on what device (e.g., &#8220;Macbook).

Happy 2018, everybody! And good riddance to the dumpster fire that was 2017.
