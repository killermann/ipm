Hi there!

I&#8217;m [Sam][1] and I write, doodle, and program/design this site. Pretty much all by myself. This comes as a surprise to most people (as evidenced by all the emails I get that are address to &#8220;the team&#8221;).

I get a lot of emails &#8212; arguably, _too many_ emails (last count: **255,087 emails** **in 2016**) &#8212; so the goal of this page is to prevent you from feeling the need to email me. Know that this comes from a place of love and kindness: if you email me, odds are I won&#8217;t see your email, and greater odds are I won&#8217;t respond. I&#8217;ll feel bad. You might feel bad. So let&#8217;s avoid all that, if we can, shall we?

## Common Asks

**If youâ€™re writing in to ask permission** to use anything on the site (e.g., to print a graphic, or copy/paste a thing into another thing), [permission granted][2]. If you just want to get in touch to say thanks, or to share something cool you made with something I made, [Twitter][3]Â is a great way to do that.

**Here are some things I DON&#8217;T do** (or no longer do), under any circumstances:

  * Post sponsored content, third party infographics, or do outside advertising in any form
  * Read/share press releases, crowdfunding requests, or other announcements
  * Host unsolicited guest blogs, articles from readers, or other outside content
  * Perform the It's Pronounced Metrosexual comedy show

So if you&#8217;re reaching out for the above things, **please know your request will be ignored**. I won't reply to requests to tell you that I don't do these things. Sorry! (This is blunt, but I&#8217;m hoping it will save you the time of reaching out, which I think is a nice form of bluntness)
