Consider this the &#8220;It&#8217;s Pronounced Metrosexual People&#8217;s Choice Awards,&#8221; because on this page you will find the posts that have been shared the most on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and the rest&#8230; by THE PEOPLE.

Starting with the [Greatest of all Time][1], and working all the way down to the [Honorably Unmentioned][2], you can read what THE PEOPLE have been telling their friends to read, presented here for your _left swiping_, tapping, or scrolling.

Enough from [me][3]. THE PEOPLE have spoken, and here&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve said:

 [1]: #GOATs
 [2]: #Honorably-Unmentioned
 [3]: /about/about-sam-killermann/
