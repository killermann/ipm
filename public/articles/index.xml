It’s become prevalent within the social justice movement, and I haven’t seen anyone else flag it. I brought it up in the context of our &lt;a href="https://www.sjmd.space">Social Justice, Minus Dogma Course + Community&lt;/a>, and it turns out other people are noticing it too. So let’s flag it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The short version is this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of people are using domination/oppression language (e.g., “white supremacist”, “patriarchal”) as synonyms for “bad” and marginalization/anti-oppression language (e.g., “indigenous,” “decolonized,” “feminist”) as synonyms for “good” — devoid of any meaningful connection to the actual structure, system, or culture they’re mentioning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My guess is that it’s a combination of our &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/isms-not-ists/">over focusing on “-ists” instead of “-isms”&lt;/a> plus the &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/">“social justice power inverse,”&lt;/a> but I’ll leave the detective work up to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why highlight this at all? In short, because actual, sincere, real-life White supremacy is on the rise, and we need to be able to call it when we see it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Calling things “White supremacist” that aren’t creates a lot of unhelpful noise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wrote this article a few days before we got a blazingly clear example of White supremacy in action, when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1150381394234941448">U.S. President Donald Trump went on a “go back to your country” rant&lt;/a> against several members of congress, all of whom are women of color.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being careful to use the phrase “White supremacy” correctly would allow a criticism of Trump’s rant, and other White supremacist actions, to be held as distinct from general criticisms of Trump.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both are totally valid, by the way! However, we need to know which basket we’re putting our eggs into.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to be able to separate “I don’t like what you’re saying” from “What you’re saying is advancing White supremacy and ethnic cleansing.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And right now we’re not doing a good job of that, at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll explain what I’m talking about in more detail, then talk about a few of the reasons &lt;em>I&lt;/em> think this is (deeply) unhelpful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’d be curious to hear what you think, if you’re also noticing this. We’ll make space for that, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="8220white-supremacist8221-doesn8217t-mean-a-8220white-person-doing-something-bad8221">“White Supremacist” doesn’t mean a “White person doing something bad”&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let me first say that, overall, it’s great that more people are becoming comfy using phrases like “white supremacist.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same goes for words like “patriarchal,” “colonial,” “heterosexist,” etc. They’re useful words that can be used to pinpoint exactly what we’re talking about, concerned about in society, and wanting to change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(If we could just add “capitalist” to our comfort zone, &lt;a href="https://www.mediaed.org/transcripts/Bell-Hooks-Transcript.pdf">we might even make bell hooks proud&lt;/a>.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The issue I’m flagging here is&lt;/strong> &lt;em>&lt;strong>not&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> &lt;strong>the use of the phrase “white supremacist”&lt;/strong> (or any of these other words I’m lumping together as domination/oppression language).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The issue is people using these words like duct tape, sticking them to every problem they notice.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here’s what it looks like in general:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How much injustice can we justify on the path toward social justice?</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/05/justifying-injustice-for-social-justice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2019 00:36:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/05/justifying-injustice-for-social-justice/</guid><description>&lt;p>Close your eyes and imagine the world you would describe as living social justice. Equitable. Utopian, even. Whatever comes to mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Give it a shot. I’ll wait a moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does it feel like to occupy that [future world][1] where all of our work as [social justice people][2] came to fruition?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How does it differ from our world today?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How radical of a difference you notice will be determined by the world you have in your mind. But surely the ways we spend our time, the social problems we grapple with, and even the ways we organize societies aren’t the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What do “jobs” look like? Do they even still exist? What about politics? What will there be more of? What will there be less of?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s likely a long list of [actions, attitudes, and beliefs][3] that wouldn’t make sense in that world, but seem perfectly sensical in our world right now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What comes to mind?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Focus on the gap, the distance between what would be normal in a socially-just world, compared to what is normal now in our oppressive and unjust world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, now here comes the really tough part:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>-isms, not -ists</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/isms-not-ists/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 16:11:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/isms-not-ists/</guid><description>&lt;p>To achieve the goals of &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/socialjustice/">social justice&lt;/a>, we need to reform society at the system level. We need to dismantle rac_ism_, sex_ism_, cissex_ism_, heterosex_ism_, gender_ism_, able_ism_, class_ism_, and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Too much of social justice discourse and calls-to-action are focused on the &lt;em>-ists&lt;/em>, the people participating in (and perpetuating) those systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Our focus on individual actors keeps increasing in social justice spaces&lt;/strong> I occupy. It’s almost all of what I notice in online social justice activism/advocacy. I’m guessing you’ve noticed it, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This focus often takes the form of &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/10/what-kind-of-social-justice-are-you-talking-about/">punitive social justice&lt;/a>, identifying perpetrators, dragging them, publicly shaming them, “canceling” them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Privilege Lie</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/the-privilege-lie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2019 23:41:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/the-privilege-lie/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve said it myself. I’ve read it a hundred times. You’ve probably heard it, or said it yourself. It usually goes something like, “We’re not asking you to give up your privileges. We’re trying to grant access to others who don’t have them.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or a pie analogy: “Privilege isn’t like pie. You don’t have to give up your slice for others to enjoy it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The idea behind these sentiments is that the goal of &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/socialjustice/">social justice&lt;/a> is not to take privileges away&lt;/strong> from the “privileged” and give them to the “oppressed” (&lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/">an unhelpful binary&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/privilege-lists/">list privileges&lt;/a> (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/">male privileges&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/11/list-of-cisgender-privileges/">cisgender privileges&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/list-of-examples-of-christian-privileg/">Christian privileges&lt;/a>) and ask people to “check their privilege,” we say we’re not asking them to give anything up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Instead, we say that the goal is for &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> to have access to those privileges.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We say this, usually, as a defense to [privileged] people pushing back against our goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>And it’s a lie. A well-intentioned lie, but a lie nonetheless.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Replacing One Binary with Another</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2019 16:43:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve always believed that one of our superpowers as gender/sexuality activists, and &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/">social justice people&lt;/a> more broadly, is our ability to hold space for nuance. In the past few years, that belief has been crumbling. In part because of how much I’m seeing us replace one way of binary thinking for another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time, we’ve known that sexuality isn’t a binary thing. It’s not gay/straight, either/or. It’s often both/and, neither, or another option altogether. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale">The Kinsey Scale&lt;/a> often comes to mind here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More recently, we’ve recognized the same thing about gender. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRcPXtqdKjE">addressed the complexities of gender&lt;/a>, viewing it on a spectrum, &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/02/gender-scales-or-spectrums/">or, better, on scales&lt;/a>. And &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/11/breaking-through-the-binary-gender-explained-using-continuums/">broken through the binary&lt;/a> of woman/man. Just like sexuality, it’s not an either/or, but more of a both/and, neither, or another option altogether.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, it’s not entirely clear to me that everyone writing about binaries (e.g., the gender binary) is saying the same thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So allow me to be clear what I mean (and have always meant) by binary: two options. Two ways to be. Two categories. And that’s it. Only two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A binary can be succinctly summed up by this (no words needed):&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Social Justice Power Inverse</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 18:19:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/</guid><description>&lt;p>A lot of social justice conversations focus on power. Who has power in society and who doesn’t?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We highlight how systems inequitably distribute power to some while withholding it from others — based on &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/individual-difference-and-group-similiarity/">who we are&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We refer to people who are granted disproportionate power as “privileged,” “majoritized,” “centered,” etc. And those from whom power is withheld as “oppressed,” “minoritized,” “marginalized,” etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, nobody is only one of those two. We’re both, depending on which situation we’re in, and what dimensions of ourselves are brought to the forefront.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our goal in talking about this is dismantling inequitable power structures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/introducing-the-social-justice-compass/">The needle on our compass points toward equity.&lt;/a> Removing barriers, promoting access, and shrinking the gap between the “haves” and “have nots” — or, in &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/">a perfect world&lt;/a>, making that dichotomy irrelevant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the things we don’t talk about is how power structures manifest in social justice spaces, or the micro-society that is the community of &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/">social justice people&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, we preserve the idea of the power structure, but swap out who sits where.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Two Worlds Dilemma</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2019 18:37:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every justice movement — from &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/gender-2/">gender&lt;/a>, to &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/sexuality">sexuality&lt;/a>, to &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/individual-difference-and-group-similiarity/">every other dimension&lt;/a> of who we are and how the world sees us — has to answer two big questions: What’s wrong with the world now?

&lt;p>I’m the fly on the wall for thousands of conversations about &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/socialjustice/">social justice&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>The ways to use a privilege list are innumerable, and the creativity I’ve witnessed has been astounding. As a tool, they can be transformative.&lt;/p>

Activists speaking and organizing in ways unchanged since 2015. Educators facilitating workshops with a curriculum written in 2012.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The world is different now than it was then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The people you’re working with — or against, or for — have different mindsets, beliefs, knowledge, perspectives, values, opinions, grudges, predispositions, awarenesses, and biases now than they did then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The world you’re working in — and trying to improve — is comprised of different technologies, constituencies, zeitgeists, cultural norms, and public knowledge now than it was then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the “then” could be yesterday. Or last year. Your “then” could be “before Trump was elected. Or “when we didn’t know this huge thing.” Or “before ‘Black Lives Matter’ activism started.” Or “when we weren’t sure whether this one thing would work or not.” Or “before our community experienced that travesty.” Or “when we didn’t have social media.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I started doing social justice work, most people didn’t know what “social justice” meant. They’d never heard the phrase. It was brand new to them. That was the first bar to jump: explaining &lt;em>what I was working to do&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s a “then”: when most people I encountered hadn’t heard the phrase “social justice.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Hypocrisy Theatre Is, and Why It Doesn’t Work</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/hypocrisy-theatre/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 18:25:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/hypocrisy-theatre/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let’s say a friend of yours made a New Year’s resolution to stop being on their phone during dinner. It’s January 4th, you’re sharing a table, and you catch them peeping their insta. You call them on it, they apologize, and put their phone away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hypocrisy, meet behavior. Behavior, meet change. &lt;em>Huzzah!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s how calling someone out on their hypocrisy &lt;em>works&lt;/em>. There are a few important factors here:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The person you’re calling out has stated (or otherwise believes) that they want to walk a particular (moral) path: &lt;strong>“From now on, I’m going to do X.”&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You notice their actions are contrary to that, and actively getting in the way of them living that espoused value, or walking their talk.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You point out this gap: “&lt;strong>You said you were going to do X, but now you’re doing Anti-X.”&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This prompts &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-cognitive-dissonance-2795012">cognitive dissonance&lt;/a>, and they have to pick a path: do as they said they’d do, or give up on that moral stance.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Each one of those four steps is necessary. They work as a chain reaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="welcome-to-hypocrisy-theatre-where-social-media-is-our-stage-and-our-audience-is-only-people-who-already-agree-with-us">Welcome to Hypocrisy Theatre: Where Social Media is Our Stage and Our Audience is Only People Who Already Agree With Us&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For several years now, there’s been a new show in town: Hypocrisy Theatre. And unlike the example above, Hypocrisy Theatre isn’t effective in changing the hypocrite’s behavior. Indeed, they’re not even part of the audience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe you’ve caught a performance of it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cast changes daily, but the show always follows the same script: some random person on social media points out that some other random person they disagree with once said something that flies in the face of a thing they’re saying now.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In &lt;em>literally&lt;/em> every case, when I’d start a conversation about Social Justice Dogma (SJD), the person I was talking with recognized the phenomenon, without me needing to explain what I meant —  even if they’d never heard the phrase “social justice dogma.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They’d reply with something like, “Oh, I know what you’re talking about,” or “Oh yeah, that’s a big thing in my circle.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we’d get into some particular tenet that they were struggling with. Or talk through a recent current event, using the dogma as the lens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the conversations generally ended the same, with them saying something like “I’m happy you’re talking about this” or “This conversation is needed” or “I’m looking forward to seeing more on this.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Even if you take the most extreme &lt;a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/biology-general/biological-determinism">biological determinist&lt;/a> stance (which a lot of the “gender isn’t a social construction” crowd take), you cannot deny the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What it means to be a “woman” or “man” changes over time (often within the timeframe of a generation — ask your grandparents if you don’t believe me).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Further, right now, the traits associated with each of those roles are different in different parts of the world (watch a sitcom from another country if you don’t believe me).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If our understanding of gender changes faster than our biology could possibly evolve, and currently exists in many forms around the world reflecting cultural differences, it’s socially constructed. End of argument. That’s what those two words, combined, &lt;em>mean.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I need tips on how to thicken my skin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here’s my issue. I’m taking Gender/Sexuality Diversity in Literature (basically Gender Studies), and there are kids in my class who don’t believe in bisexuality, let alone *my* sexuality (aka. pansexuality). I’m an easy crier and I just know that when this rather basic problem surfaces–because I’ve only ever heard these kids mutter their opinions under their breath–I won’t make it through the conversation. So, tips?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve thought about coming out to the class (I’m out to my friends, family, most teachers, and Facebook, but most people don’t know) but haven’t. I want people to step on eggshells because they’re being inclusive, not because I’m in the room and they don’t want to offend me personally.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I don’t often do things by accident, and in this case it is very _on purpose.  _My flavor is even so noticeable that if you’ve seen a lot of what I’ve created here, you’re likely taken aback by the headline of this article.  Well, that actually leads me into my first point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Reasons for being an Ally (AKA Social Justice Advocate)</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/5-reasons-im-a-social-justice-all/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 May 2012 20:00:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/5-reasons-im-a-social-justice-all/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey, folks.  First of all, thanks for continuing to read what I write here, and thanks even more for sharing.  I don't say that enough.  I've been thinking a lot about why I do what I do lately, and I want to once-and-for-all answer a question I get asked an average of 1.6 times per day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Sam, why do you do what you do?&amp;rdquo; people say, but they are only saying half of what they're thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Depending on the context, they might be thinking, &amp;ldquo;Sam, if you're straight, why do you work so much for gay equality?&amp;rdquo;  Or &amp;ldquo;Sam, you're a man, why do you work so much for women's or trans people's equality&amp;rdquo;  Or &amp;ldquo;Sam, you're White, why do you care about equality for people of color?&amp;rdquo;  Or &amp;ldquo;Sam, you're a huge dork, why don't you do anything about that?&amp;rdquo;  And on it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My answer is different every time, because it's hard for me to get down to the absolute root of it all.  But let me provide some of the front-runner explanations for why I do what I do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why your intentions don’t really matter, but outcomes do</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/04/why-your-intentions-dont-matter-victim-blaming-and-political-correctness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Apr 2012 23:34:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/04/why-your-intentions-dont-matter-victim-blaming-and-political-correctness/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ingrids-intentionality-elixir.jpg">&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve created a &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->few&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->graphics&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> about &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->when it’s okay to say “gay”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the one argument that keeps coming up goes something like “How can you regulate language? What’s offensive to one person is not to another.  What matters is your intentions.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Intentions don’t matter, effect does.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will elaborate on my response to that question more in a bit, but first I want to pose another question, and posit an answer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3 Reasons Positive Stereotypes aren’t that Positive</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/04/reasons-positive-stereotypes-are-not-positive/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2012 04:30:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/04/reasons-positive-stereotypes-are-not-positive/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->my show&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I address the issue of positive stereotypes head-on, but I wanted to write an article about it as well.  For those of you unaware, positive stereotypes are assumptions about an entire group or identity (e.g., gay men) that are considered to be “good.”  Some examples of positive stereotypes of gay men: they are artsy, friendly, fun, social, well-spoken, well-dressed, well-groomed, fit, and sassy (I think sassy is positive).  The list goes on.  Those are all good things, yeah?  There can’t be any harm in perpetuating those stereotypes, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Positive stereotypes exist for just about every identity and have the capacity to be just as damaging as the negative ones.  Don’t believe me?  Read this list of reasons why and get back to me afterward.  Oh, and if you have any additional examples, as always, share them in the comments below.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5+ Ways to Make Our World More Trans*-Friendly</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/04/list-of-ways-to-make-world-trans-friendl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2012 17:55:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/04/list-of-ways-to-make-world-trans-friendl/</guid><description>&lt;p>We live in a world that recognizes two options for gender.  If you’re not &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> “man” or “woman” you’re going to have a hard time finding your place, because right now there isn’t a &lt;em>place&lt;/em> for you.  Let’s change that.&lt;/p>
