I&amp;#8217;m going to keep this short. I just put together an E-Book called &amp;#8220;Defining LGBTQ+.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s a guide to gender and sexuality terminology, based on my article Comprehensive List of LGBTQ+ Vocabulary Definitions, which was based on the glossary from my first book (A Guide to Gender), that grew into a collaboration with Meg Bolger (The Safe Zone Project) and thousands of you.</description></item><item><title>Why Think of Gender on Scales Instead of a Spectrum?</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/02/gender-scales-or-spectrums/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2019 01:41:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/02/gender-scales-or-spectrums/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to gender, most people have a similar understanding of it in their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

No, that doesn’t mean it’s not real.</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/09/yes-gender-is-a-social-construction-no-that-doesnt-mean-its-not-real/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2018 21:26:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/09/yes-gender-is-a-social-construction-no-that-doesnt-mean-its-not-real/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Gender is a social construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you take the most extreme &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/biology-general/biological-determinism&#34;&gt;biological determinist&lt;/a&gt; stance (which a lot of the &amp;#8220;gender isn&amp;#8217;t a social construction&amp;#8221; crowd take), you cannot deny the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What it means to be a &amp;#8220;woman&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;man&amp;#8221; changes over time (often within the timeframe of a generation &amp;#8212; ask your grandparents if you don&amp;#8217;t believe me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further, right now, the traits associated with each of those roles are different in different parts of the world (watch a sitcom from another country if you don&amp;#8217;t believe me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our understanding of gender changes faster than our biology could possibly evolve, and currently exists in many forms around the world reflecting cultural differences, it&amp;#8217;s socially constructed. End of argument. That&amp;#8217;s what those two words, combined, &lt;em&gt;mean.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And gender is real.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because something&amp;#8217;s a social construction doesn&amp;#8217;t mean it&amp;#8217;s not real (despite many fellow &amp;#8220;social construction&amp;#8221; folks saying so).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Self-Guided Foundational Safe Zone Training</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/courses/self-guided-foundational-safe-zone-training/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2018 17:34:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/courses/self-guided-foundational-safe-zone-training/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Learn about your first impressions of LGBTQ+ people, core vocabulary, gender &amp;amp; sexuality theory, privilege &amp;amp; coming out, and get your questions answered.&amp;rdquo;

It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat Robertson famously said this in the 90s, and the sentiment still rings as true in the ears of many today.  It’s an understatement to say that &lt;a href=&#34;http://everydayfeminism.com/2012/07/feminist-myths/&#34; title=&#34;How Most Things You Know About Feminists Are Vicious Conservative Lies&#34;&gt;feminism has a bad rap.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
