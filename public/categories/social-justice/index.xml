It&amp;#8217;s become prevalent within the social justice movement, and I haven&amp;#8217;t seen anyone else flag it. I brought it up in the context of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sjmd.space&#34;&gt;Social Justice, Minus Dogma Course + Community&lt;/a&gt;, and it turns out other people are noticing it too. So let&amp;#8217;s flag it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short version is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people are using domination/oppression language (e.g., &amp;#8220;white supremacist&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;patriarchal&amp;#8221;) as synonyms for &amp;#8220;bad&amp;#8221; and marginalization/anti-oppression language (e.g., &amp;#8220;indigenous,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;decolonized,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;feminist&amp;#8221;) as synonyms for &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; devoid of any meaningful connection to the actual structure, system, or culture they&amp;#8217;re mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that it&amp;#8217;s a combination of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/isms-not-ists/&#34;&gt;over focusing on &amp;#8220;-ists&amp;#8221; instead of &amp;#8220;-isms&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; plus the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;social justice power inverse,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; but I&amp;#8217;ll leave the detective work up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why highlight this at all? In short, because actual, sincere, real-life White supremacy is on the rise, and we need to be able to call it when we see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling things &amp;#8220;White supremacist&amp;#8221; that aren&amp;#8217;t creates a lot of unhelpful noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this article a few days before we got a blazingly clear example of White supremacy in action, when &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1150381394234941448&#34;&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump went on a &amp;#8220;go back to your country&amp;#8221; rant&lt;/a&gt; against several members of congress, all of whom are women of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being careful to use the phrase &amp;#8220;White supremacy&amp;#8221; correctly would allow a criticism of Trump&amp;#8217;s rant, and other White supremacist actions, to be held as distinct from general criticisms of Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are totally valid, by the way! However, we need to know which basket we&amp;#8217;re putting our eggs into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be able to separate &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t like what you&amp;#8217;re saying&amp;#8221; from &amp;#8220;What you&amp;#8217;re saying is advancing White supremacy and ethnic cleansing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And right now we&amp;#8217;re not doing a good job of that, at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll explain what I&amp;#8217;m talking about in more detail, then talk about a few of the reasons &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; think this is (deeply) unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d be curious to hear what you think, if you&amp;#8217;re also noticing this. We&amp;#8217;ll make space for that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8220-white-supremacist-8221-doesn-8217-t-mean-a-8220-white-person-doing-something-bad-8221&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;White Supremacist&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t mean a &amp;#8220;White person doing something bad&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me first say that, overall, it&amp;#8217;s great that more people are becoming comfy using phrases like &amp;#8220;white supremacist.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for words like &amp;#8220;patriarchal,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;colonial,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;heterosexist,&amp;#8221; etc. They&amp;#8217;re useful words that can be used to pinpoint exactly what we&amp;#8217;re talking about, concerned about in society, and wanting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If we could just add &amp;#8220;capitalist&amp;#8221; to our comfort zone, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mediaed.org/transcripts/Bell-Hooks-Transcript.pdf&#34;&gt;we might even make bell hooks proud&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue I&amp;#8217;m flagging here is&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the use of the phrase &amp;#8220;white supremacist&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (or any of these other words I&amp;#8217;m lumping together as domination/oppression language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue is people using these words like duct tape, sticking them to every problem they notice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what it looks like in general:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Social Justice Minus Dogma Online Course</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/courses/social-justice-minus-dogma-course/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2019 17:34:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/courses/social-justice-minus-dogma-course/</guid><description>Over the course of 6 weeks of self-guided learning (or however long you choose), explore the social justice dogma, identify its cornerstones and pitfalls, and plot a path forward toward true living social justice.

Equitable. Utopian, even. Whatever comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give it a shot. I’ll wait a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it feel like to occupy that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/&#34;&gt;future world&lt;/a&gt; where all of our work as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/&#34;&gt;social justice people&lt;/a&gt; came to fruition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does it differ from our world today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How radical of a difference you notice will be determined by the world you have in your mind. But surely the ways we spend our time, the social problems we grapple with, and even the ways we organize societies aren&amp;#8217;t the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do “jobs” look like? Do they even still exist? What about politics? What will there be more of? What will there be less of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s likely a long list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/introducing-the-social-justice-compass/&#34;&gt;actions, attitudes, and beliefs&lt;/a&gt; that wouldn’t make sense in that world, but seem perfectly sensical in our world right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes to mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the gap, the distance between what would be normal in a socially-just world, compared to what is normal now in our oppressive and unjust world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now here comes the really tough part:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>-isms, not -ists</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/isms-not-ists/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 16:11:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/isms-not-ists/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To achieve the goals of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/socialjustice/&#34;&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt;, we need to reform society at the system level. We need to dismantle rac&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, sex&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, cissex&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, heterosex&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, gender&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, able&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, class&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much of social justice discourse and calls-to-action are focused on the &lt;em&gt;-ists&lt;/em&gt;, the people participating in (and perpetuating) those systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our focus on individual actors keeps increasing in social justice spaces&lt;/strong&gt; I occupy. It’s almost all of what I notice in online social justice activism/advocacy. I’m guessing you’ve noticed it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This focus often takes the form of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/10/what-kind-of-social-justice-are-you-talking-about/&#34;&gt;punitive social justice&lt;/a&gt;, identifying perpetrators, dragging them, publicly shaming them, “canceling” them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Privilege Lie</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/the-privilege-lie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2019 23:41:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/the-privilege-lie/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve said it myself. I&amp;#8217;ve read it a hundred times. You&amp;#8217;ve probably heard it, or said it yourself. It usually goes something like, &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re not asking you to give up your privileges. We&amp;#8217;re trying to grant access to others who don&amp;#8217;t have them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a pie analogy: &amp;#8220;Privilege isn&amp;#8217;t like pie. You don&amp;#8217;t have to give up your slice for others to enjoy it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea behind these sentiments is that the goal of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/socialjustice/&#34;&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt; is not to take privileges away&lt;/strong&gt; from the &amp;#8220;privileged&amp;#8221; and give them to the &amp;#8220;oppressed&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/&#34;&gt;an unhelpful binary&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/privilege-lists/&#34;&gt;list privileges&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/&#34;&gt;male privileges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/11/list-of-cisgender-privileges/&#34;&gt;cisgender privileges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/list-of-examples-of-christian-privileg/&#34;&gt;Christian privileges&lt;/a&gt;) and ask people to &amp;#8220;check their privilege,&amp;#8221; we say we&amp;#8217;re not asking them to give anything up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead, we say that the goal is for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; to have access to those privileges.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say this, usually, as a defense to [privileged] people pushing back against our goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s a lie. A well-intentioned lie, but a lie nonetheless.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Replacing One Binary with Another</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2019 16:43:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always believed that one of our superpowers as gender/sexuality activists, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/&#34;&gt;social justice people&lt;/a&gt; more broadly, is our ability to hold space for nuance. In the past few years, that belief has been crumbling. In part because of how much I&amp;#8217;m seeing us replace one way of binary thinking for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, we&amp;#8217;ve known that sexuality isn&amp;#8217;t a binary thing. It&amp;#8217;s not gay/straight, either/or. It&amp;#8217;s often both/and, neither, or another option altogether. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale&#34;&gt;The Kinsey Scale&lt;/a&gt; often comes to mind here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, we&amp;#8217;ve recognized the same thing about gender. We&amp;#8217;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRcPXtqdKjE&#34;&gt;addressed the complexities of gender&lt;/a&gt;, viewing it on a spectrum, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/02/gender-scales-or-spectrums/&#34;&gt;or, better, on scales&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/11/breaking-through-the-binary-gender-explained-using-continuums/&#34;&gt;broken through the binary&lt;/a&gt; of woman/man. Just like sexuality, it&amp;#8217;s not an either/or, but more of a both/and, neither, or another option altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;#8217;s not entirely clear to me that everyone writing about binaries (e.g., the gender binary) is saying the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So allow me to be clear what I mean (and have always meant) by binary: two options. Two ways to be. Two categories. And that&amp;#8217;s it. Only two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A binary can be succinctly summed up by this (no words needed):&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Social Justice Power Inverse</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 18:19:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of social justice conversations focus on power. Who has power in society and who doesn&amp;#8217;t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We highlight how systems inequitably distribute power to some while withholding it from others &amp;#8212; based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/individual-difference-and-group-similiarity/&#34;&gt;who we are&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We refer to people who are granted disproportionate power as &amp;#8220;privileged,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;majoritized,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;centered,&amp;#8221; etc. And those from whom power is withheld as &amp;#8220;oppressed,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;minoritized,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;marginalized,&amp;#8221; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, nobody is only one of those two. We&amp;#8217;re both, depending on which situation we&amp;#8217;re in, and what dimensions of ourselves are brought to the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal in talking about this is dismantling inequitable power structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/introducing-the-social-justice-compass/&#34;&gt;The needle on our compass points toward equity.&lt;/a&gt; Removing barriers, promoting access, and shrinking the gap between the &amp;#8220;haves&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;have nots&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; or, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/&#34;&gt;a perfect world&lt;/a&gt;, making that dichotomy irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we don&amp;#8217;t talk about is how power structures manifest in social justice spaces, or the micro-society that is the community of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/&#34;&gt;social justice people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we preserve the idea of the power structure, but swap out who sits where.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Two Worlds Dilemma</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2019 18:37:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Every justice movement &amp;#8212; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/gender-2/&#34;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/sexuality&#34;&gt;sexuality&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/individual-difference-and-group-similiarity/&#34;&gt;every other dimension&lt;/a&gt; of who we are and how the world sees us &amp;#8212; has to answer two big questions: What&amp;#8217;s wrong with the world now?

&lt;p&gt;First, I want to say how blown away I am that so many people are up for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few weeks, I showed a question at the top of the site to some readers asking if you&amp;#8217;d want to participate in a course about &amp;#8220;social justice, minus dogma.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m wasn&amp;#8217;t sure what to expect, but I was bracing for &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How (Not) To Use a Privilege List</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/how-not-to-use-a-privilege-list/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 18:34:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/how-not-to-use-a-privilege-list/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/privilege-lists/&#34;&gt;Privilege Lists&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/about/about-sam-killermann/&#34;&gt;I’ve&lt;/a&gt; published &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/about/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; have been downloaded over 100 million times cumulatively. I share this because it’s cool to say (big number!), but also because that reach has allowed me to see these lists used in a variety of ways: some good, some neutral, and some downright harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ways to use a privilege list are innumerable, and the creativity I’ve witnessed has been astounding. As a tool, they can be transformative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avast!&lt;/em&gt; A new model for thinking about and doing social justice&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;ho&lt;/em&gt;! This is off to a bad start. It turns out that every day can be &lt;a href=&#34;http://talklikeapirate.com/wordpress/&#34;&gt;International Talk like a Pirate Day&lt;/a&gt; if you don&amp;#8217;t care about having friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you care about social justice, friend, well, look no further!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;#8217;m happy to share with you a new model for thinking about social justice, for considering your actions, attitudes, and beliefs, and for guiding yourself and your community toward equity: The Social Justice Compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>If You’re Still Doing Social Justice How You Were Then, Reconsider.</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/social-justice-then-and-now/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 19:41:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/social-justice-then-and-now/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve seen people at conferences giving the same talk they gave two years ago. Activists speaking and organizing in ways unchanged since 2015. Educators facilitating workshops with a curriculum written in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is different now than it was then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people you&amp;#8217;re working with &amp;#8212; or against, or for &amp;#8212; have different mindsets, beliefs, knowledge, perspectives, values, opinions, grudges, predispositions, awarenesses, and biases now than they did then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world you&amp;#8217;re working in &amp;#8212; and trying to improve &amp;#8212; is comprised of different technologies, constituencies, zeitgeists, cultural norms, and public knowledge now than it was then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;#8220;then&amp;#8221; could be yesterday. Or last year. Your &amp;#8220;then&amp;#8221; could be &amp;#8220;before Trump was elected. Or &amp;#8220;when we didn&amp;#8217;t know this huge thing.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;before &amp;#8216;Black Lives Matter&amp;#8217; activism started.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;when we weren&amp;#8217;t sure whether this one thing would work or not.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;before our community experienced that travesty.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;when we didn&amp;#8217;t have social media.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started doing social justice work, most people didn&amp;#8217;t know what &amp;#8220;social justice&amp;#8221; meant. They&amp;#8217;d never heard the phrase. It was brand new to them. That was the first bar to jump: explaining &lt;em&gt;what I was working to do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;then&amp;#8221;: when most people I encountered hadn&amp;#8217;t heard the phrase &amp;#8220;social justice.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What Hypocrisy Theatre Is, and Why It Doesn’t Work</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/hypocrisy-theatre/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 18:25:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/hypocrisy-theatre/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say a friend of yours made a New Year&amp;#8217;s resolution to stop being on their phone during dinner. It&amp;#8217;s January 4th, you&amp;#8217;re sharing a table, and you catch them peeping their insta. You call them on it, they apologize, and put their phone away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypocrisy, meet behavior. Behavior, meet change. &lt;em&gt;Huzzah!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s how calling someone out on their hypocrisy &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;. There are a few important factors here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person you&amp;#8217;re calling out has stated (or otherwise believes) that they want to walk a particular (moral) path: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;From&amp;nbsp;now&amp;nbsp;on,&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;going&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;do X.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You notice their actions are contrary to that, and actively getting in the way of them living that espoused value, or walking their talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You point out this gap: &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;You said you were going to do X, but now you&amp;#8217;re doing Anti-X.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This prompts &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-cognitive-dissonance-2795012&#34;&gt;cognitive dissonance&lt;/a&gt;, and they have to pick a path: do as they said they&amp;#8217;d do, or give up on that moral stance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each one of those four steps is necessary. They work as a chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;welcome-to-hypocrisy-theatre-where-social-media-is-our-stage-and-our-audience-is-only-people-who-already-agree-with-us&#34;&gt;Welcome to Hypocrisy Theatre: Where Social Media is Our Stage and Our Audience is Only People Who Already Agree With Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years now, there&amp;#8217;s been a new show in town: Hypocrisy Theatre. And unlike the example above, Hypocrisy Theatre isn&amp;#8217;t effective in changing the hypocrite&amp;#8217;s behavior. Indeed, they&amp;#8217;re not even part of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#8217;ve caught a performance of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cast changes daily, but the show always follows the same script: some random person on social media points out that some other random person they disagree with once said something that flies in the face of a thing they&amp;#8217;re saying now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; every case, when I&amp;#8217;d start a conversation about Social Justice Dogma (SJD), the person I was talking with recognized the phenomenon, without me needing to explain what I meant &amp;#8212;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;even if they&amp;#8217;d never heard the phrase &amp;#8220;social justice dogma.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;d reply with something like, &amp;#8220;Oh, I know what you&amp;#8217;re talking about,&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Oh yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a big thing in my circle.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we&amp;#8217;d get into some particular tenet that they were struggling with. Or talk through a recent current event, using the dogma as the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the conversations generally ended the same, with them saying something like &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m happy you&amp;#8217;re talking about this&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;This conversation is needed&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to seeing more on this.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the conversation ended.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What kind of “Social Justice” are you talking about?</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/10/what-kind-of-social-justice-are-you-talking-about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2018 20:57:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/10/what-kind-of-social-justice-are-you-talking-about/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I had lunch with a friend this week, and our conversation hit a peculiar roadblock: A lot of people are saying the same words &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;social justice&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; but meaning different things.

The first is that some of the people who like the cool thing start to covet it, protect it from outsiders, and claim it as their own &amp;#8212; when just moments before those same people were making desperate pleas to others to like the thing they liked.</description></item><item><title>The Magical Power of “Some” for Social Justice Educators</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/magical-power-social-justice-educators/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Mar 2018 22:56:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/magical-power-social-justice-educators/</guid><description>There are few things that changed how effective of a social justice educator I was as much as the word “some.”
