Perhaps you are &lt;a href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/01/social-justice-then-and-now/&#34;&gt;rethinking how you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; social justice now&lt;/a&gt;, today, in 2019 &amp;#8212; with everything happening in the world &amp;#8212; and searching for a new path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avast!&lt;/em&gt; A new model for thinking about and doing social justice&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;ho&lt;/em&gt;! This is off to a bad start. It turns out that every day can be &lt;a href=&#34;http://talklikeapirate.com/wordpress/&#34;&gt;International Talk like a Pirate Day&lt;/a&gt; if you don&amp;#8217;t care about having friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you care about social justice, friend, well, look no further!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;#8217;m happy to share with you a new model for thinking about social justice, for considering your actions, attitudes, and beliefs, and for guiding yourself and your community toward equity: The Social Justice Compass.&lt;/p&gt;

In September 2016, I was asked to participate in Katie Couric&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Gender Revolution&amp;#8221; documentary (by National Geographic). The following questions were what I worked through &amp;#8212; and what I generally work through &amp;#8212; when deciding to say &amp;#8220;yes&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;no.</description></item><item><title>What makes a relationship healthy?

Relationships are generally seen through the lenses of our gender as well as our sexuality, but there are many other aspects of our identity that are going to inform what we see as good or bad, desirable or detestable, healthy or unhealthy.</description></item><item><title>The Many Elements of Comprehensive Sexuality: Meet the Sexualitree</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2016/05/sexualitree-model-of-comprehensive-sexuality/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2016 21:52:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2016/05/sexualitree-model-of-comprehensive-sexuality/</guid><description>Sexuality is a touchy subject. For example, just that opening joke might have been enough to turn someone off (I could go all day. But I won&amp;#8217;t.). As easy as it is to make awkward puns, or be uncomfortable in general talking about sexuality, it&amp;#8217;s an important subject that affects all of us on different levels of our lives.</description></item><item><title>When Someone Comes Out To You: DO &amp; DON’T</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2016/04/when-someone-comes-out-to-you-do-dont/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 20:32:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2016/04/when-someone-comes-out-to-you-do-dont/</guid><description>In one of the first safe zone trainings I remember participating in, there was a loaded question about coming out that was followed by an excellent answer from the facilitator.
