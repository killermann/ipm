Hundreds of millions of downloads, shares, and resources distributed later, as we're about to embark on a new decade, I figured it was time to recreate this site.</description></item><item><title>Incoming: “Social Justice, Minus Dogma” Course + Community</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/social-justice-dogma-course-community/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2019 19:49:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/social-justice-dogma-course-community/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over 1,000 of you said you’d want to participate in an &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/970acc41bb9c/social-justice-minus-dogma">online course and community focusing on Social Justice, Minus Dogma&lt;/a>.

&lt;/address>
&lt;p>First, I want to say how blown away I am that so many people are up for this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a few weeks, I showed a question at the top of the site to some readers asking if you’d want to participate in a course about “social justice, minus dogma.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m wasn’t sure what to expect, but I was bracing for &lt;em>bad&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New E-Book: Defining LGBTQ+</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/02/defining-lgbtq-guide-to-gender-sexuality-terminology/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2019 00:21:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/02/defining-lgbtq-guide-to-gender-sexuality-terminology/</guid><description>Hi friends! I’m going to keep this short. I just put together an E-Book called “Defining LGBTQ+.” It’s a guide to gender and sexuality terminology, based on my article Comprehensive List of LGBTQ+ Vocabulary Definitions, which was based on the glossary from my first book (A Guide to Gender), that grew into a collaboration with Meg Bolger (The Safe Zone Project) and thousands of you.</description></item><item><title>The State of this Site (Or “Funding Online Work in 2018, an Infographic”)</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/09/the-state-of-this-site-or-funding-online-work-in-2018-an-infographic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:25:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/09/the-state-of-this-site-or-funding-online-work-in-2018-an-infographic/</guid><description>I’ve been running this site for about 7 years now.
