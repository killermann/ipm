&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need tips on how to thicken my skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s my issue. I&amp;#8217;m taking Gender/Sexuality Diversity in Literature (basically Gender Studies), and there are kids in my class who don&amp;#8217;t believe in bisexuality, let alone *my* sexuality (aka. pansexuality). I&amp;#8217;m an easy crier and I just know that when this rather basic problem surfaces&amp;#8211;because I&amp;#8217;ve only ever heard these kids mutter their opinions under their breath&amp;#8211;I won&amp;#8217;t make it through the conversation. So, tips?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve thought about coming out to the class (I&amp;#8217;m out to my friends, family, most teachers, and Facebook, but most people don&amp;#8217;t know) but haven&amp;#8217;t. I want people to step on eggshells because they&amp;#8217;re being inclusive, not because I&amp;#8217;m in the room and they don&amp;#8217;t want to offend me personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts? Totally fine if not. A snarky one-liner would be just as welcome, because you&amp;#8217;re hilarious and shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sam, why do you do what you do?&amp;rdquo; people say, but they are only saying half of what they&amp;rsquo;re thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the context, they might be thinking, &amp;ldquo;Sam, if you&amp;rsquo;re¬†straight, why do you work so much for gay equality?&amp;rdquo; ¬†Or &amp;ldquo;Sam, you&amp;rsquo;re a man, why do you work so much for women&amp;rsquo;s or trans people&amp;rsquo;s equality&amp;rdquo; ¬†Or &amp;ldquo;Sam, you&amp;rsquo;re White, why do you care about equality for people of color?&amp;rdquo; ¬†Or &amp;ldquo;Sam, you&amp;rsquo;re a huge dork, why don&amp;rsquo;t you do anything about that?&amp;rdquo; ¬†And on it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer is different every time, because it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to get down to the absolute root of it all. ¬†But let me provide some of the front-runner explanations for why I do what I do.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>One reason I‚Äôm a social justice advocate (as a white, straight, male)</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/02/one-reason-i-do-what-i-do/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2012 21:29:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/02/one-reason-i-do-what-i-do/</guid><description>I&amp;#8217;ve dedicated my life to progressing social justice, in the hopes that one day we can have a society that is equitable for all.
