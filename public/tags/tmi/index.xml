&lt;p>I need tips on how to thicken my skin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here’s my issue. I’m taking Gender/Sexuality Diversity in Literature (basically Gender Studies), and there are kids in my class who don’t believe in bisexuality, let alone *my* sexuality (aka. pansexuality). I’m an easy crier and I just know that when this rather basic problem surfaces–because I’ve only ever heard these kids mutter their opinions under their breath–I won’t make it through the conversation. So, tips?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve thought about coming out to the class (I’m out to my friends, family, most teachers, and Facebook, but most people don’t know) but haven’t. I want people to step on eggshells because they’re being inclusive, not because I’m in the room and they don’t want to offend me personally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any thoughts? Totally fine if not. A snarky one-liner would be just as welcome, because you’re hilarious and shit.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Sam, why do you do what you do?&amp;rdquo; people say, but they are only saying half of what they're thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Depending on the context, they might be thinking, &amp;ldquo;Sam, if you're straight, why do you work so much for gay equality?&amp;rdquo;  Or &amp;ldquo;Sam, you're a man, why do you work so much for women's or trans people's equality&amp;rdquo;  Or &amp;ldquo;Sam, you're White, why do you care about equality for people of color?&amp;rdquo;  Or &amp;ldquo;Sam, you're a huge dork, why don't you do anything about that?&amp;rdquo;  And on it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My answer is different every time, because it's hard for me to get down to the absolute root of it all.  But let me provide some of the front-runner explanations for why I do what I do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One reason I’m a social justice advocate (as a white, straight, male)</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/02/one-reason-i-do-what-i-do/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2012 21:29:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/02/one-reason-i-do-what-i-do/</guid><description>I’ve dedicated my life to progressing social justice, in the hopes that one day we can have a society that is equitable for all.
