I‚Äôve read it a hundred times. You‚Äôve probably heard it, or said it yourself. It usually goes something like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking you to give up your privileges. We‚Äôre trying to grant access to others who don‚Äôt have them.‚Äù&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or a pie analogy: ‚ÄúPrivilege isn‚Äôt like pie. You don‚Äôt have to give up your slice for others to enjoy it.‚Äù&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The idea behind these sentiments is that the goal of &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/socialjustice/">social justice&lt;/a> is not to take privileges away&lt;/strong> from the ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù and give them to the ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù (&lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/">an unhelpful binary&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/privilege-lists/">list privileges&lt;/a> (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/">male privileges&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/11/list-of-cisgender-privileges/">cisgender privileges&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/list-of-examples-of-christian-privileg/">Christian privileges&lt;/a>) and ask people to ‚Äúcheck their privilege,‚Äù we say we‚Äôre not asking them to give anything up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Instead, we say that the goal is for &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> to have access to those privileges.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We say this, usually, as a defense to [privileged] people pushing back against our goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>And it‚Äôs a lie. A well-intentioned lie, but a lie nonetheless.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Social Justice Power Inverse</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 18:19:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/</guid><description>&lt;p>A lot of social justice conversations focus on power. Who has power in society and who doesn‚Äôt?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We highlight how systems inequitably distribute power to some while withholding it from others ‚Äî based on &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/individual-difference-and-group-similiarity/">who we are&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We refer to people who are granted disproportionate power as ‚Äúprivileged,‚Äù ‚Äúmajoritized,‚Äù ‚Äúcentered,‚Äù etc. And those from whom power is withheld as ‚Äúoppressed,‚Äù ‚Äúminoritized,‚Äù ‚Äúmarginalized,‚Äù etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, nobody is only one of those two. We‚Äôre both, depending on which situation we‚Äôre in, and what dimensions of ourselves are brought to the forefront.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our goal in talking about this is dismantling inequitable power structures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/introducing-the-social-justice-compass/">The needle on our compass points toward equity.&lt;/a> Removing barriers, promoting access, and shrinking the gap between the ‚Äúhaves‚Äù and ‚Äúhave nots‚Äù ‚Äî or, in &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/">a perfect world&lt;/a>, making that dichotomy irrelevant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the things we don‚Äôt talk about is how power structures manifest in social justice spaces, or the micro-society that is the community of &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/">social justice people&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, we preserve the idea of the power structure, but swap out who sits where.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How (Not) To Use a Privilege List</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/how-not-to-use-a-privilege-list/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 18:34:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/how-not-to-use-a-privilege-list/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/privilege-lists/">Privilege Lists&lt;/a> that &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/about/about-sam-killermann/">I‚Äôve&lt;/a> published &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/about/">here&lt;/a> have been downloaded over 100 million times cumulatively. I share this because it‚Äôs cool to say (big number!), but also because that reach has allowed me to see these lists used in a variety of ways: some good, some neutral, and some downright harmful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ways to use a privilege list are innumerable, and the creativity I‚Äôve witnessed has been astounding. As a tool, they can be transformative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead of using this space to advocate for ways I encourage using the lists, it‚Äôll be easier to write few quick ‚ÄúPlease Don‚Äôt Do This‚Äù bullets:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Self-Guided Foundational Safe Zone Training</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/courses/self-guided-foundational-safe-zone-training/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2018 17:34:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/courses/self-guided-foundational-safe-zone-training/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Learn about your first impressions of LGBTQ+ people, core vocabulary, gender &amp;amp; sexuality theory, privilege &amp;amp; coming out, and get your questions answered.&amp;rdquo;
That's from the course description, and does a good job of summing this up.
