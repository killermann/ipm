I&amp;#8217;ve read it a hundred times. You&amp;#8217;ve probably heard it, or said it yourself. It usually goes something like, &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re not asking you to give up your privileges. We&amp;#8217;re trying to grant access to others who don&amp;#8217;t have them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a pie analogy: &amp;#8220;Privilege isn&amp;#8217;t like pie. You don&amp;#8217;t have to give up your slice for others to enjoy it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea behind these sentiments is that the goal of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/socialjustice/&#34;&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt; is not to take privileges away&lt;/strong&gt; from the &amp;#8220;privileged&amp;#8221; and give them to the &amp;#8220;oppressed&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/&#34;&gt;an unhelpful binary&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/privilege-lists/&#34;&gt;list privileges&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/&#34;&gt;male privileges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/11/list-of-cisgender-privileges/&#34;&gt;cisgender privileges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/list-of-examples-of-christian-privileg/&#34;&gt;Christian privileges&lt;/a&gt;) and ask people to &amp;#8220;check their privilege,&amp;#8221; we say we&amp;#8217;re not asking them to give anything up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead, we say that the goal is for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; to have access to those privileges.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say this, usually, as a defense to [privileged] people pushing back against our goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s a lie. A well-intentioned lie, but a lie nonetheless.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Social Justice Power Inverse</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 18:19:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of social justice conversations focus on power. Who has power in society and who doesn&amp;#8217;t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We highlight how systems inequitably distribute power to some while withholding it from others &amp;#8212; based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/individual-difference-and-group-similiarity/&#34;&gt;who we are&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We refer to people who are granted disproportionate power as &amp;#8220;privileged,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;majoritized,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;centered,&amp;#8221; etc. And those from whom power is withheld as &amp;#8220;oppressed,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;minoritized,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;marginalized,&amp;#8221; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, nobody is only one of those two. We&amp;#8217;re both, depending on which situation we&amp;#8217;re in, and what dimensions of ourselves are brought to the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal in talking about this is dismantling inequitable power structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/introducing-the-social-justice-compass/&#34;&gt;The needle on our compass points toward equity.&lt;/a&gt; Removing barriers, promoting access, and shrinking the gap between the &amp;#8220;haves&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;have nots&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; or, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/&#34;&gt;a perfect world&lt;/a&gt;, making that dichotomy irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we don&amp;#8217;t talk about is how power structures manifest in social justice spaces, or the micro-society that is the community of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/&#34;&gt;social justice people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we preserve the idea of the power structure, but swap out who sits where.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How (Not) To Use a Privilege List</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/how-not-to-use-a-privilege-list/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 18:34:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/how-not-to-use-a-privilege-list/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/privilege-lists/&#34;&gt;Privilege Lists&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/about/about-sam-killermann/&#34;&gt;I’ve&lt;/a&gt; published &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/about/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; have been downloaded over 100 million times cumulatively. I share this because it’s cool to say (big number!), but also because that reach has allowed me to see these lists used in a variety of ways: some good, some neutral, and some downright harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ways to use a privilege list are innumerable, and the creativity I’ve witnessed has been astounding. As a tool, they can be transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of using this space to advocate for ways I encourage using the lists, it’ll be easier to write few quick “Please Don’t Do This” bullets:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Self-Guided Foundational Safe Zone Training</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/courses/self-guided-foundational-safe-zone-training/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2018 17:34:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/courses/self-guided-foundational-safe-zone-training/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Learn about your first impressions of LGBTQ+ people, core vocabulary, gender &amp;amp; sexuality theory, privilege &amp;amp; coming out, and get your questions answered.&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s from the course description, and does a good job of summing this up. I co-created this course with Meg Bolger based on our years of experience facilitating countless in-person Safe Zone workshops.</description></item><item><title>Dear White, Straight, Cisgender, Man People: You Are Privileged</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2014/05/dear-white-straight-cisgender-men-privilege/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 17:17:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2014/05/dear-white-straight-cisgender-men-privilege/</guid><description>I&amp;#8217;ve written about privilege here, and I&amp;#8217;ve written my own privilege lists, inspired by Peggy McIntosh (blame her!), which have garnered a lot of hullabaloo on my site. Now, there seems to be a groundswell of backlash, where privileged people (like this super privileged Princeton student) are &amp;#8220;denouncing their privilege&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;finally standing up for straight white guys&amp;#8221; (HAHAHA).</description></item><item><title>30&#43; Examples of Masculine Dude (“Bro”) Privileges</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2013/02/30-examples-of-masculine-dude-bro-privilege/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2013 23:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2013/02/30-examples-of-masculine-dude-bro-privilege/</guid><description>I&amp;#8217;ve written a few privilege lists, several of which are about privileged identities I possess.

I ask that you please humor me as I take a moment to address the many privileges I _don&amp;#8217;t _have access to, due to my gender expression/ metrosexuality.</description></item><item><title>30&#43; Examples of Male Privileges</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2012 20:49:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/</guid><description>Following is a list of male privileges. &amp;nbsp;If you are male (and a man), listed below are benefits that result from being born with that gender and sex.
