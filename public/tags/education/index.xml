Perhaps you are &lt;a href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/01/social-justice-then-and-now/&#34;&gt;rethinking how you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; social justice now&lt;/a&gt;, today, in 2019 &amp;#8212; with everything happening in the world &amp;#8212; and searching for a new path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avast!&lt;/em&gt; A new model for thinking about and doing social justice&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;ho&lt;/em&gt;! This is off to a bad start. It turns out that every day can be &lt;a href=&#34;http://talklikeapirate.com/wordpress/&#34;&gt;International Talk like a Pirate Day&lt;/a&gt; if you don&amp;#8217;t care about having friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you care about social justice, friend, well, look no further!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;#8217;m happy to share with you a new model for thinking about social justice, for considering your actions, attitudes, and beliefs, and for guiding yourself and your community toward equity: The Social Justice Compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>If You’re Still Doing Social Justice How You Were Then, Reconsider.</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/01/social-justice-then-and-now/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 19:41:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/01/social-justice-then-and-now/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve seen people at conferences giving the same talk they gave two years ago. Activists speaking and organizing in ways unchanged since 2015. Educators facilitating workshops with a curriculum written in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is different now than it was then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people you&amp;#8217;re working with &amp;#8212; or against, or for &amp;#8212; have different mindsets, beliefs, knowledge, perspectives, values, opinions, grudges, predispositions, awarenesses, and biases now than they did then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world you&amp;#8217;re working in &amp;#8212; and trying to improve &amp;#8212; is comprised of different technologies, constituencies, zeitgeists, cultural norms, and public knowledge now than it was then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;#8220;then&amp;#8221; could be yesterday. Or last year. Your &amp;#8220;then&amp;#8221; could be &amp;#8220;before Trump was elected. Or &amp;#8220;when we didn&amp;#8217;t know this huge thing.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;before &amp;#8216;Black Lives Matter&amp;#8217; activism started.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;when we weren&amp;#8217;t sure whether this one thing would work or not.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;before our community experienced that travesty.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;when we didn&amp;#8217;t have social media.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started doing social justice work, most people didn&amp;#8217;t know what &amp;#8220;social justice&amp;#8221; meant. They&amp;#8217;d never heard the phrase. It was brand new to them. That was the first bar to jump: explaining &lt;em&gt;what I was working to do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;then&amp;#8221;: when most people I encountered hadn&amp;#8217;t heard the phrase &amp;#8220;social justice.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Genderbread Person version 4</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/10/the-genderbread-person-v4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 06:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/10/the-genderbread-person-v4/</guid><description>A few hundred workshops, three years, and one book edition later, I&amp;#8217;m happy to finally publish here my 4th version of the Genderbread Person.

This is a second-part response to &lt;a title=&#34;Top Ten Tips on how to Thicken your Skin&#34; href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/09/tips-on-thickening-skin-in-social-justice-work/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an email I received&lt;/a&gt; from a high school senior (it&amp;#8217;d probably help contextualize if you read her email first).  
&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisexuality is a thing. It&amp;#8217;s not just &amp;#8220;a stop between gay and straight.&amp;#8221; But how do you explain that to someone who just. simply. won&amp;#8217;t. believe. you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to focus on the struggle many bisexual and pansexual folks have convincing their straight (or gay/lesbian) peers that bisexuality is an identity, not just a stopping point between two others.  While I&amp;#8217;m focusing this article on advice for bi- and pansexual folks, some of it applies to all sexuality discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need tips on how to thicken my skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s my issue. I&amp;#8217;m taking Gender/Sexuality Diversity in Literature (basically Gender Studies), and there are kids in my class who don&amp;#8217;t believe in bisexuality, let alone *my* sexuality (aka. pansexuality). I&amp;#8217;m an easy crier and I just know that when this rather basic problem surfaces&amp;#8211;because I&amp;#8217;ve only ever heard these kids mutter their opinions under their breath&amp;#8211;I won&amp;#8217;t make it through the conversation. So, tips?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve thought about coming out to the class (I&amp;#8217;m out to my friends, family, most teachers, and Facebook, but most people don&amp;#8217;t know) but haven&amp;#8217;t. I want people to step on eggshells because they&amp;#8217;re being inclusive, not because I&amp;#8217;m in the room and they don&amp;#8217;t want to offend me personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts? Totally fine if not. A snarky one-liner would be just as welcome, because you&amp;#8217;re hilarious and shit.&lt;/p&gt;
