&lt;p&gt;I find myself saying &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;re not the same, but we&amp;#8217;re also not that different,&amp;#8221; to the furrowing of brows, so I wanted to take a moment here to talk about the relationship of individual identity and social group memberships, as well as introduce a new graphic concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to respond when someone uses non-inclusive (or bigoted) language</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/06/how-to-respond-to-non-inclusive-language-or-bigoted-speec/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jun 2012 21:24:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/06/how-to-respond-to-non-inclusive-language-or-bigoted-speec/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Why your intentions don‚Äôt really matter, but outcomes do&#34; href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/04/why-your-intentions-dont-matter-victim-blaming-and-political-correctness/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Intentions don&amp;#8217;t matter, outcomes do&lt;/a&gt;. ¬†However, I still think we need to do a much better job of being supportive of newcomers to the social justice &amp;#8220;scene&amp;#8221; who may be well-intended, but don&amp;#8217;t quite know the ropes yet. ¬†&lt;/p&gt;
