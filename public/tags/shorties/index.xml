We need to dismantle rac-&lt;em>ism&lt;/em>, sex-&lt;em>ism&lt;/em>, cissex-&lt;em>ism&lt;/em>, heterosex-&lt;em>ism&lt;/em>, gender-&lt;em>ism&lt;/em>, able-&lt;em>ism&lt;/em>, class-&lt;em>ism&lt;/em>, and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Too much of social justice discourse and calls-to-action are focused on the &lt;em>-ists&lt;/em>, the people participating in (and perpetuating) those systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Our focus on individual actors keeps increasing in social justice spaces&lt;/strong> I occupy. It’s almost all of what I notice in online social justice activism/advocacy. I’m guessing you’ve noticed it, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This focus often takes the form of &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/10/what-kind-of-social-justice-are-you-talking-about/">punitive social justice&lt;/a>, identifying perpetrators, dragging them, publicly shaming them, “canceling” them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Privilege Lie</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/the-privilege-lie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2019 23:41:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/the-privilege-lie/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve said it myself. I’ve read it a hundred times. You’ve probably heard it, or said it yourself. It usually goes something like, “We’re not asking you to give up your privileges. We’re trying to grant access to others who don’t have them.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or a pie analogy: “Privilege isn’t like pie. You don’t have to give up your slice for others to enjoy it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The idea behind these sentiments is that the goal of &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/socialjustice/">social justice&lt;/a> is not to take privileges away&lt;/strong> from the “privileged” and give them to the “oppressed” (&lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/">an unhelpful binary&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/privilege-lists/">list privileges&lt;/a> (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/">male privileges&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/11/list-of-cisgender-privileges/">cisgender privileges&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/list-of-examples-of-christian-privileg/">Christian privileges&lt;/a>) and ask people to “check their privilege,” we say we’re not asking them to give anything up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Instead, we say that the goal is for &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> to have access to those privileges.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We say this, usually, as a defense to [privileged] people pushing back against our goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>And it’s a lie. A well-intentioned lie, but a lie nonetheless.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Social Justice Power Inverse</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 18:19:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/</guid><description>&lt;p>A lot of social justice conversations focus on power. Who has power in society and who doesn’t?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We highlight how systems inequitably distribute power to some while withholding it from others — based on &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/individual-difference-and-group-similiarity/">who we are&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We refer to people who are granted disproportionate power as “privileged,” “majoritized,” “centered,” etc. And those from whom power is withheld as “oppressed,” “minoritized,” “marginalized,” etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, nobody is only one of those two. We’re both, depending on which situation we’re in, and what dimensions of ourselves are brought to the forefront.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our goal in talking about this is dismantling inequitable power structures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/introducing-the-social-justice-compass/">The needle on our compass points toward equity.&lt;/a> Removing barriers, promoting access, and shrinking the gap between the “haves” and “have nots” — or, in &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/">a perfect world&lt;/a>, making that dichotomy irrelevant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the things we don’t talk about is how power structures manifest in social justice spaces, or the micro-society that is the community of &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/">social justice people&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, we preserve the idea of the power structure, but swap out who sits where.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Two Worlds Dilemma</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2019 18:37:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every justice movement — from &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/gender-2/">gender&lt;/a>, to &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/sexuality">sexuality&lt;/a>, to &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/individual-difference-and-group-similiarity/">every other dimension&lt;/a> of who we are and how the world sees us — has to answer two big questions: What’s wrong with the world now? And what future world do you want to create?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m the fly on the wall for thousands of conversations about &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/socialjustice/">social justice&lt;/a>. And a lot of what I witness online and in-person (in workshops and conferences and retreats) goes off the rails because of &lt;strong>The Two Worlds Dilemma&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How (Not) To Use a Privilege List</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/how-not-to-use-a-privilege-list/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 18:34:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/how-not-to-use-a-privilege-list/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/privilege-lists/">Privilege Lists&lt;/a> that &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/about/about-sam-killermann/">I’ve&lt;/a> published &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/about/">here&lt;/a> have been downloaded over 100 million times cumulatively. I share this because it’s cool to say (big number!), but also because that reach has allowed me to see these lists used in a variety of ways: some good, some neutral, and some downright harmful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ways to use a privilege list are innumerable, and the creativity I’ve witnessed has been astounding. As a tool, they can be transformative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead of using this space to advocate for ways I encourage using the lists, it’ll be easier to write few quick “Please Don’t Do This” bullets:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yes, gender is a social construction. No, that doesn’t mean it’s not real.</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/09/yes-gender-is-a-social-construction-no-that-doesnt-mean-its-not-real/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2018 21:26:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/09/yes-gender-is-a-social-construction-no-that-doesnt-mean-its-not-real/</guid><description>&lt;p>Gender is a social construction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if you take the most extreme &lt;a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/biology-general/biological-determinism">biological determinist&lt;/a> stance (which a lot of the “gender isn’t a social construction” crowd take), you cannot deny the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What it means to be a “woman” or “man” changes over time (often within the timeframe of a generation — ask your grandparents if you don’t believe me).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Further, right now, the traits associated with each of those roles are different in different parts of the world (watch a sitcom from another country if you don’t believe me).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If our understanding of gender changes faster than our biology could possibly evolve, and currently exists in many forms around the world reflecting cultural differences, it’s socially constructed. End of argument. That’s what those two words, combined, &lt;em>mean.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>And gender is real.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just because something’s a social construction doesn’t mean it’s not real (despite many fellow “social construction” folks saying so).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some Different Taxonomies for Social Justice People</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Mar 2018 22:29:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/</guid><description>We often group social justice people by identity, cause, or “-ism” (e.g., racial justice people, gender justice, queer justice, wage justice).
