Hundreds of comments, ditto emails, ditto Facebook messages and Twitter tweeters and in-person holla-atchas and I feel like I’m finally in a place to release this.</description></item><item><title>The Genderbread Person</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/01/the-genderbread-person/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2012 20:01:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/01/the-genderbread-person/</guid><description>Please check out the new-and-improved Genderbread Person v2.0.
