It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.‚Äù&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pat Robertson famously said this in the 90s, and the sentiment still rings as true in the ears of many today. ¬†It‚Äôs an understatement to say that¬†&lt;a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/2012/07/feminist-myths/" title="How Most Things You Know About Feminists Are Vicious Conservative Lies">feminism has a bad rap.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feminism doesn‚Äôt hate men.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To achieve social justice we will have to break down a lot of huge barriers that exist on a scale far above the individual, but even the biggest scale change is nothing more than the sum of &lt;em>a whole lot&lt;/em> of individual efforts. ¬†My goal with this site is to support you in doing just that: making big change on an individual level.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I don‚Äôt often do things by accident, and in this case it is very _on purpose. ¬†_My flavor is even so noticeable that if you‚Äôve seen a lot of what I‚Äôve created here, you‚Äôre likely taken aback by the headline of this article. ¬†Well, that actually leads me into my first point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Reasons for being an Ally (AKA Social Justice Advocate)</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/5-reasons-im-a-social-justice-all/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 May 2012 20:00:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/5-reasons-im-a-social-justice-all/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey, folks. ¬†First of all, thanks for continuing to read what I write here, and thanks even more for sharing. ¬†I don't say that enough. ¬†I've been thinking a lot about why I do what I do lately, and I want to once-and-for-all answer a question I get asked an average of 1.6 times per day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Sam, why do you do what you do?&amp;rdquo; people say, but they are only saying half of what they're thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Depending on the context, they might be thinking, &amp;ldquo;Sam, if you're¬†straight, why do you work so much for gay equality?&amp;rdquo; ¬†Or &amp;ldquo;Sam, you're a man, why do you work so much for women's or trans people's equality&amp;rdquo; ¬†Or &amp;ldquo;Sam, you're White, why do you care about equality for people of color?&amp;rdquo; ¬†Or &amp;ldquo;Sam, you're a huge dork, why don't you do anything about that?&amp;rdquo; ¬†And on it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My answer is different every time, because it's hard for me to get down to the absolute root of it all. ¬†But let me provide some of the front-runner explanations for why I do what I do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3 Reasons Positive Stereotypes aren‚Äôt that Positive</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/04/reasons-positive-stereotypes-are-not-positive/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2012 04:30:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/04/reasons-positive-stereotypes-are-not-positive/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a title="A show about snap judgments, identity, and oppression." href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/a-show-about-snap-judgments-identity-and-oppression/" target="_blank">my show&lt;/a>, I address the issue of positive stereotypes head-on, but I wanted to write an article about it as well. ¬†For those of you unaware, positive stereotypes are assumptions about an entire group or identity (e.g., gay men) that are considered to be &amp;ldquo;good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some examples of positive stereotypes of gay men: they are artsy, friendly, fun, social, well-spoken, well-dressed, well-groomed, fit, and sassy (I think sassy is positive). ¬†The list goes on. ¬†Those are all good things, yeah? ¬†There can‚Äôt be any harm in perpetuating those stereotypes, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Positive stereotypes exist for just about every identity and have the capacity to be just as damaging as the negative ones. ¬†Don‚Äôt believe me? ¬†Read this list of reasons why and get back to me afterward. ¬†Oh, and if you have any additional examples, as always, share them in the comments below.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5+ Ways to Make Our World More Trans*-Friendly</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/04/list-of-ways-to-make-world-trans-friendl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2012 17:55:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/04/list-of-ways-to-make-world-trans-friendl/</guid><description>&lt;p>We live in a world that recognizes two options for gender. ¬†If you‚Äôre not &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> ‚Äúman‚Äù or ‚Äúwoman‚Äù you‚Äôre going to have a hard time finding your place, because right now there isn‚Äôt a &lt;em>place&lt;/em>¬†for you. ¬†Let‚Äôs change that.&lt;/p>
