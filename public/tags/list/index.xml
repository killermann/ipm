They are serious articles that provide a couple hundred examples of systemic oppression (in the US and elsewhere). This article is not that.
I ask that you please humor me as I take a moment to address the many privileges I¬†_don&amp;#8217;t¬†_have access to, due to my gender expression/ metrosexuality.</description></item><item><title>Comprehensive* List of LGBTQ&#43; Vocabulary Definitions</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2013/01/a-comprehensive-list-of-lgbtq-term-definitions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2013 23:46:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2013/01/a-comprehensive-list-of-lgbtq-term-definitions/</guid><description>Hi!

It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat Robertson famously said this in the 90s, and the sentiment still rings as true in the ears of many today. ¬†It‚Äôs an understatement to say that¬†&lt;a href=&#34;http://everydayfeminism.com/2012/07/feminist-myths/&#34; title=&#34;How Most Things You Know About Feminists Are Vicious Conservative Lies&#34;&gt;feminism has a bad rap.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feminism doesn‚Äôt hate men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve social justice we will have to break down a lot of huge barriers that exist on a scale far above the individual, but even the biggest scale change is nothing more than the sum of &lt;em&gt;a whole lot&lt;/em&gt; of individual efforts. ¬†My goal with this site is to support you in doing just that: making big change on an individual level.&lt;/p&gt;
