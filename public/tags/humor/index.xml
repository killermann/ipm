And I got to talk about a lot of the dimensions of my work that I usually don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ndash; stuff that usually stays behind the scenes.</description></item><item><title>9&#43; Silly Gender Comics I drew in 5 Minutes or Less</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2013/05/silly-gender-comics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2013 01:19:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2013/05/silly-gender-comics/</guid><description>I made all of these comics for my book. Some of them are in there. Some didn&amp;#8217;t make the cut. And many more that aren&amp;#8217;t here did. Hope they give you a gender-equity giggle.</description></item><item><title>My TED Talk: Understanding the Complexities of Gender</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2013/05/my-ted-talk-understanding-the-complexities-of-gender/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2013 17:34:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2013/05/my-ted-talk-understanding-the-complexities-of-gender/</guid><description>I had the honor of being asked to give another TEDx talk, and they let me do it all about gender.
You can watch the video below, and see as I try to condense hundreds of pages of my book into 16 minutes of comprehensible, enjoyable, and sometimes-rhyming words.</description></item><item><title>30&#43; Examples of Masculine Dude (“Bro”) Privileges</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2013/02/30-examples-of-masculine-dude-bro-privilege/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2013 23:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2013/02/30-examples-of-masculine-dude-bro-privilege/</guid><description>I&amp;#8217;ve written a few privilege lists, several of which are about privileged identities I possess. They are serious articles that provide a couple hundred examples of systemic oppression (in the US and elsewhere). This article is not that.
I ask that you please humor me as I take a moment to address the many privileges I _don&amp;#8217;t _have access to, due to my gender expression/ metrosexuality.</description></item><item><title>How To Avoid Being a Stereotype</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/06/how-to-avoid-being-a-stereotype/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2012 23:57:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/06/how-to-avoid-being-a-stereotype/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;You want to be seen as an individual, right?  Of course you do.  But it&amp;#8217;s bordering on impossible to avoid perpetuating at least some of the stereotypes attached to the various aspects of your identity.  There are just too many of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#8217;s where I can help.  Consider this a &amp;#8220;How to be [X], without being a stereotypical [X]&amp;#8221; guide.  I&amp;#8217;m hitting a variety of major identities, but feel free to request addendums to the guide in the comments below, on &lt;a href=&#34;http://facebook.com/metrosam&#34; title=&#34;http://facebook.com/metrosam&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, or on &lt;a title=&#34;http://twitter.com/actuallymetro&#34; href=&#34;http://twitter.com/actuallymetro&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you&amp;#8217;re more prone to spot-reading than reading-reading, &lt;strong&gt;I strongly encourage you to at least read the last section before you formulate your reaction to this article&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

@EricTeske pointed out the Super Bowl ad below, with the following comment:
The add features a decidedly gay-friendly moment, and we&amp;#8217;re not talking about the Lionel Richie (he&amp;#8217;s straight, folks). About 8 seconds in a man is presented with options for a super-hot near-naked ladies couch, or a super-hot near-naked dudes couch.</description></item><item><title>Little Girl Goes on a Rant Over Pink Toys</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/01/little-girl-goes-on-a-rant-over-pink-toys-video/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2012 18:42:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/01/little-girl-goes-on-a-rant-over-pink-toys-video/</guid><description>How awesome is this?!
So many of us have experienced the frustration of being told something isn&amp;rsquo;t for us &amp;ndash; something we wanted to wear, or play with, or be &amp;ndash; because of our gender. It&amp;rsquo;s outrageous, and it&amp;rsquo;s something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be going away any time soon.</description></item><item><title>10 reasons LEGOs aren’t for girls</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/01/10-reasonslegos-arent-for-girls/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2012 22:45:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/01/10-reasonslegos-arent-for-girls/</guid><description>Update: check out this video of a little girl explaining her frustration with gendered toys. It&amp;#8217;s amazing how gendered toys are. If you see an action figure, you think boy. If you see a barbie, you think girl. If you see a boy with a barbie, you think gay.</description></item><item><title>Why same-sex marriage is constitutional, and marrying a toaster is not.</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2011/12/why-same-sex-marriage-is-constitutional-and-marrying-a-toaster-is-not/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2011 21:07:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2011/12/why-same-sex-marriage-is-constitutional-and-marrying-a-toaster-is-not/</guid><description>A graphic representation of an issue that should be simpler than it is, but it always leading to absurd slippery-slope arguments.
