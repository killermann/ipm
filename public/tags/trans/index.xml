No, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not real.</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/09/yes-gender-is-a-social-construction-no-that-doesnt-mean-its-not-real/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2018 21:26:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/09/yes-gender-is-a-social-construction-no-that-doesnt-mean-its-not-real/</guid><description>&lt;p>Gender is¬†a social construction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if you take the most extreme¬†&lt;a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/biology-general/biological-determinism">biological determinist&lt;/a> stance (which a lot of the ‚Äúgender isn‚Äôt a social construction‚Äù crowd take), you cannot deny the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What it means to be a¬†‚Äúwoman‚Äù or ‚Äúman‚Äù changes over time (often within the timeframe of a generation ‚Äî ask your grandparents if you don‚Äôt believe me).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Further, right now, the traits associated with each of those roles are different in different parts of the world (watch a sitcom from another country if you don‚Äôt believe me).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If our understanding of gender changes faster than our biology could possibly evolve, and currently exists in many forms around the world reflecting cultural differences, it‚Äôs socially constructed. End of argument. That‚Äôs what those two words, combined,¬†&lt;em>mean.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>And gender is real.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just because something‚Äôs a social construction doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not real (despite many fellow ‚Äúsocial construction‚Äù folks saying so).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One Huge Prickly Reason Why Anti-LGBTQ Folks Don‚Äôt Change Their Views</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/01/ignored-reason-people-dont-affirm-lgbtq-people-make-harder/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2018 20:08:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/01/ignored-reason-people-dont-affirm-lgbtq-people-make-harder/</guid><description>I need you to take a leap with me.
Leap into the shoes of someone who has walked through their life knowing that being gay, being bi, lesbian, or pan, or that being non-binary, gender non-conforming, or trans ‚Äî that being different, different from straight, different from cisgender ‚Äî is wrong.</description></item><item><title>What's the best way to view gender?
