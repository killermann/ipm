No, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not real.</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/09/yes-gender-is-a-social-construction-no-that-doesnt-mean-its-not-real/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2018 21:26:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/09/yes-gender-is-a-social-construction-no-that-doesnt-mean-its-not-real/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Gender is¬†a social construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you take the most extreme¬†&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/biology-general/biological-determinism&#34;&gt;biological determinist&lt;/a&gt; stance (which a lot of the &amp;#8220;gender isn&amp;#8217;t a social construction&amp;#8221; crowd take), you cannot deny the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What it means to be a¬†&amp;#8220;woman&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;man&amp;#8221; changes over time (often within the timeframe of a generation &amp;#8212; ask your grandparents if you don&amp;#8217;t believe me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further, right now, the traits associated with each of those roles are different in different parts of the world (watch a sitcom from another country if you don&amp;#8217;t believe me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our understanding of gender changes faster than our biology could possibly evolve, and currently exists in many forms around the world reflecting cultural differences, it&amp;#8217;s socially constructed. End of argument. That&amp;#8217;s what those two words, combined,¬†&lt;em&gt;mean.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And gender is real.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because something&amp;#8217;s a social construction doesn&amp;#8217;t mean it&amp;#8217;s not real (despite many fellow &amp;#8220;social construction&amp;#8221; folks saying so).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>One Huge Prickly Reason Why Anti-LGBTQ Folks Don‚Äôt Change Their Views</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/01/ignored-reason-people-dont-affirm-lgbtq-people-make-harder/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2018 20:08:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/01/ignored-reason-people-dont-affirm-lgbtq-people-make-harder/</guid><description>I need you to take a leap with me.
Leap into the shoes of someone who has walked through their life knowing that being gay, being bi, lesbian, or pan, or that being non-binary, gender non-conforming, or trans ‚Äî that being different, different from straight, different from cisgender ‚Äî is wrong.</description></item><item><title>What&#39;s the best way to view gender?
