Leap into the shoes of someone who has walked through their life knowing that being gay, being bi, lesbian, or pan, or that being non-binary, gender non-conforming, or trans — that being different, different from straight, different from cisgender — is wrong.</description></item><item><title>How to explain that bisexuality (or pansexuality) is real</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/09/how-to-explain-to-someone-bisexuality-or-pansexuality-is-real/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2012 20:24:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/09/how-to-explain-to-someone-bisexuality-or-pansexuality-is-real/</guid><description>&lt;address&gt;
This is a second-part response to &lt;a title=&#34;Top Ten Tips on how to Thicken your Skin&#34; href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/09/tips-on-thickening-skin-in-social-justice-work/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an email I received&lt;/a&gt; from a high school senior (it&amp;#8217;d probably help contextualize if you read her email first).  
&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisexuality is a thing. It&amp;#8217;s not just &amp;#8220;a stop between gay and straight.&amp;#8221; But how do you explain that to someone who just. simply. won&amp;#8217;t. believe. you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to focus on the struggle many bisexual and pansexual folks have convincing their straight (or gay/lesbian) peers that bisexuality is an identity, not just a stopping point between two others.  While I&amp;#8217;m focusing this article on advice for bi- and pansexual folks, some of it applies to all sexuality discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have three main approaches you can take below, but I&amp;#8217;d love to hear suggestions for more ways to breach this subject in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Flowchart: I Want To Say Gay (When it’s Okay)</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/04/even-better-flowchart-when-its-okay-to-say-gay/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Apr 2012 19:34:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/04/even-better-flowchart-when-its-okay-to-say-gay/</guid><description>When I published my original flowchart, I said it was for the more analytical folks who are wondering if &amp;#8220;gay&amp;#8221; is the right word choice for them.

A tall order, but at least we can make it an accomplishable one.

Same-sex marriages are happening, gays are serving openly in the military, and the world isn&amp;#8217;t falling apart (well, maybe it is, but it was a preexisting condition).
Yet anti-human-rights activists like Santorum and the rest of the Slippery Slopers can&amp;#8217;t help but remind us that gay marriage is just the beginning.</description></item><item><title>30&#43; Examples of Heterosexual (Straight) Privileges</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/01/29-examples-of-heterosexual-privilege/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2012 23:03:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/01/29-examples-of-heterosexual-privilege/</guid><description>Following is a list of&amp;nbsp;examples of heterosexual privilege. &amp;nbsp;If you are straight,&amp;nbsp;these are unearned benefits you receive as a result of the sexuality you were born with.
If you are straight (or in some cases, perceived to be), you can live without ever having to think twice, face, confront, engage, or cope with anything listed below.</description></item><item><title>Why same-sex marriage is constitutional, and marrying a toaster is not.</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2011/12/why-same-sex-marriage-is-constitutional-and-marrying-a-toaster-is-not/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2011 21:07:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2011/12/why-same-sex-marriage-is-constitutional-and-marrying-a-toaster-is-not/</guid><description>A graphic representation of an issue that should be simpler than it is, but it always leading to absurd slippery-slope arguments.

Check it, share it, print it, love it. Also, check out the new-and-improved flowchart. For those of you still struggling with the idea of when it is and isn&amp;#8217;t ideal to use the word &amp;#8220;gay&amp;#8221;, even after reading my article outlining the whole idea, I decided to create a few visual aids.</description></item></channel></rss>
