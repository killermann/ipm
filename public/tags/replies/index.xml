This is a second-part response to &lt;a title=&#34;Top Ten Tips on how to Thicken your Skin&#34; href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/09/tips-on-thickening-skin-in-social-justice-work/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an email I received&lt;/a&gt; from a high school senior (it&amp;#8217;d probably help contextualize if you read her email first).  
&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisexuality is a thing. It&amp;#8217;s not just &amp;#8220;a stop between gay and straight.&amp;#8221; But how do you explain that to someone who just. simply. won&amp;#8217;t. believe. you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to focus on the struggle many bisexual and pansexual folks have convincing their straight (or gay/lesbian) peers that bisexuality is an identity, not just a stopping point between two others.  While I&amp;#8217;m focusing this article on advice for bi- and pansexual folks, some of it applies to all sexuality discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have three main approaches you can take below, but I&amp;#8217;d love to hear suggestions for more ways to breach this subject in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Top Ten Tips on how to Thicken your Skin</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/09/tips-on-thickening-skin-in-social-justice-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 21:23:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/09/tips-on-thickening-skin-in-social-justice-work/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I received the following email from a high school senior (we&amp;#8217;ll call her Angie), replied to her, she appreciated the response and told me she&amp;#8217;d be cool with me sharing it with you folks in case any one else might be able to find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angie&amp;#8217;s Email:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need tips on how to thicken my skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s my issue. I&amp;#8217;m taking Gender/Sexuality Diversity in Literature (basically Gender Studies), and there are kids in my class who don&amp;#8217;t believe in bisexuality, let alone *my* sexuality (aka. pansexuality). I&amp;#8217;m an easy crier and I just know that when this rather basic problem surfaces&amp;#8211;because I&amp;#8217;ve only ever heard these kids mutter their opinions under their breath&amp;#8211;I won&amp;#8217;t make it through the conversation. So, tips?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve thought about coming out to the class (I&amp;#8217;m out to my friends, family, most teachers, and Facebook, but most people don&amp;#8217;t know) but haven&amp;#8217;t. I want people to step on eggshells because they&amp;#8217;re being inclusive, not because I&amp;#8217;m in the room and they don&amp;#8217;t want to offend me personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts? Totally fine if not. A snarky one-liner would be just as welcome, because you&amp;#8217;re hilarious and shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s since backtracked a lot, and wishy-washied, and etc.  But it&amp;#8217;s as apparent how he truly feels as it is how bad he is at playing politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;focus&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I sent him an email.  It&amp;#8217;s below.  Discuss.
&lt;/p&gt;
