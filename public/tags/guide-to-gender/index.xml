It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pat Robertson famously said this in the 90s, and the sentiment still rings as true in the ears of many today.  It’s an understatement to say that &lt;a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/2012/07/feminist-myths/" title="How Most Things You Know About Feminists Are Vicious Conservative Lies">feminism has a bad rap.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feminism doesn’t hate men.&lt;/p>

Let’s look at a few explanations for this fallacy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>30+ Examples of Male Privileges</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2012 20:49:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/</guid><description>Following is a list of male privileges.
