It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pat Robertson famously said this in the 90s, and the sentiment still rings as true in the ears of many today.  It’s an understatement to say that &lt;a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/2012/07/feminist-myths/" title="How Most Things You Know About Feminists Are Vicious Conservative Lies">feminism has a bad rap.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feminism doesn’t hate men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why do so many people think feminism = man-hating? Let’s look at a few explanations for this fallacy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>30+ Examples of Male Privileges</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2012 20:49:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/</guid><description>Following is a list of male privileges.

&lt;p>I find myself saying “we’re not the same, but we’re also not that different,” to the furrowing of brows, so I wanted to take a moment here to talk about the relationship of individual identity and social group memberships, as well as introduce a new graphic concept.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Avoid Being a Stereotype</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/06/how-to-avoid-being-a-stereotype/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2012 23:57:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/06/how-to-avoid-being-a-stereotype/</guid><description>&lt;p>You want to be seen as an individual, right?  Of course you do.  But it’s bordering on impossible to avoid perpetuating at least some of the stereotypes attached to the various aspects of your identity.  There are just too many of them!&lt;/p>
