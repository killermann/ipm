It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat Robertson famously said this in the 90s, and the sentiment still rings as true in the ears of many today.  It’s an understatement to say that &lt;a href=&#34;http://everydayfeminism.com/2012/07/feminist-myths/&#34; title=&#34;How Most Things You Know About Feminists Are Vicious Conservative Lies&#34;&gt;feminism has a bad rap.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feminism doesn’t hate men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do so many people think feminism = man-hating? Let’s look at a few explanations for this fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>30&#43; Examples of Male Privileges</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2012 20:49:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/</guid><description>Following is a list of male privileges. &amp;nbsp;If you are male (and a man), listed below are benefits that result from being born with that gender and sex.

&lt;p&gt;I find myself saying &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;re not the same, but we&amp;#8217;re also not that different,&amp;#8221; to the furrowing of brows, so I wanted to take a moment here to talk about the relationship of individual identity and social group memberships, as well as introduce a new graphic concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How To Avoid Being a Stereotype</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/06/how-to-avoid-being-a-stereotype/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2012 23:57:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/06/how-to-avoid-being-a-stereotype/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;You want to be seen as an individual, right?  Of course you do.  But it&amp;#8217;s bordering on impossible to avoid perpetuating at least some of the stereotypes attached to the various aspects of your identity.  There are just too many of them!&lt;/p&gt;
