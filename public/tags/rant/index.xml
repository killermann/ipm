We need to dismantle rac&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, sex&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, cissex&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, heterosex&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, gender&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, able&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, class&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much of social justice discourse and calls-to-action are focused on the &lt;em&gt;-ists&lt;/em&gt;, the people participating in (and perpetuating) those systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our focus on individual actors keeps increasing in social justice spaces&lt;/strong&gt; I occupy. It’s almost all of what I notice in online social justice activism/advocacy. I’m guessing you’ve noticed it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This focus often takes the form of &lt;a href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/10/what-kind-of-social-justice-are-you-talking-about/&#34;&gt;punitive social justice&lt;/a&gt;, identifying perpetrators, dragging them, publicly shaming them, “canceling” them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Replacing One Binary with Another</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2019 16:43:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always believed that one of our superpowers as gender/sexuality activists, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/&#34;&gt;social justice people&lt;/a&gt; more broadly, is our ability to hold space for nuance. In the past few years, that belief has been crumbling. In part because of how much I&amp;#8217;m seeing us replace one way of binary thinking for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, we&amp;#8217;ve known that sexuality isn&amp;#8217;t a binary thing. It&amp;#8217;s not gay/straight, either/or. It&amp;#8217;s often both/and, neither, or another option altogether. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale&#34;&gt;The Kinsey Scale&lt;/a&gt; often comes to mind here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, we&amp;#8217;ve recognized the same thing about gender. We&amp;#8217;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRcPXtqdKjE&#34;&gt;addressed the complexities of gender&lt;/a&gt;, viewing it on a spectrum, &lt;a href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/02/gender-scales-or-spectrums/&#34;&gt;or, better, on scales&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2011/11/breaking-through-the-binary-gender-explained-using-continuums/&#34;&gt;broken through the binary&lt;/a&gt; of woman/man. Just like sexuality, it&amp;#8217;s not an either/or, but more of a both/and, neither, or another option altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;#8217;s not entirely clear to me that everyone writing about binaries (e.g., the gender binary) is saying the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So allow me to be clear what I mean (and have always meant) by binary: two options. Two ways to be. Two categories. And that&amp;#8217;s it. Only two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A binary can be succinctly summed up by this (no words needed):&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What Hypocrisy Theatre Is, and Why It Doesn’t Work</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/01/hypocrisy-theatre/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 18:25:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/01/hypocrisy-theatre/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say a friend of yours made a New Year&amp;#8217;s resolution to stop being on their phone during dinner. It&amp;#8217;s January 4th, you&amp;#8217;re sharing a table, and you catch them peeping their insta. You call them on it, they apologize, and put their phone away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypocrisy, meet behavior. Behavior, meet change. &lt;em&gt;Huzzah!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s how calling someone out on their hypocrisy &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;. There are a few important factors here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person you&amp;#8217;re calling out has stated (or otherwise believes) that they want to walk a particular (moral) path: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;From&amp;nbsp;now&amp;nbsp;on,&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;going&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;do X.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You notice their actions are contrary to that, and actively getting in the way of them living that espoused value, or walking their talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You point out this gap: &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;You said you were going to do X, but now you&amp;#8217;re doing Anti-X.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This prompts &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-cognitive-dissonance-2795012&#34;&gt;cognitive dissonance&lt;/a&gt;, and they have to pick a path: do as they said they&amp;#8217;d do, or give up on that moral stance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each one of those four steps is necessary. They work as a chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;welcome-to-hypocrisy-theatre-where-social-media-is-our-stage-and-our-audience-is-only-people-who-already-agree-with-us&#34;&gt;Welcome to Hypocrisy Theatre: Where Social Media is Our Stage and Our Audience is Only People Who Already Agree With Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years now, there&amp;#8217;s been a new show in town: Hypocrisy Theatre. And unlike the example above, Hypocrisy Theatre isn&amp;#8217;t effective in changing the hypocrite&amp;#8217;s behavior. Indeed, they&amp;#8217;re not even part of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#8217;ve caught a performance of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cast changes daily, but the show always follows the same script: some random person on social media points out that some other random person they disagree with once said something that flies in the face of a thing they&amp;#8217;re saying now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It often looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yes, gender is a social construction. No, that doesn’t mean it’s not real.</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/09/yes-gender-is-a-social-construction-no-that-doesnt-mean-its-not-real/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2018 21:26:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/09/yes-gender-is-a-social-construction-no-that-doesnt-mean-its-not-real/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Gender is a social construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you take the most extreme &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/biology-general/biological-determinism&#34;&gt;biological determinist&lt;/a&gt; stance (which a lot of the &amp;#8220;gender isn&amp;#8217;t a social construction&amp;#8221; crowd take), you cannot deny the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What it means to be a &amp;#8220;woman&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;man&amp;#8221; changes over time (often within the timeframe of a generation &amp;#8212; ask your grandparents if you don&amp;#8217;t believe me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further, right now, the traits associated with each of those roles are different in different parts of the world (watch a sitcom from another country if you don&amp;#8217;t believe me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our understanding of gender changes faster than our biology could possibly evolve, and currently exists in many forms around the world reflecting cultural differences, it&amp;#8217;s socially constructed. End of argument. That&amp;#8217;s what those two words, combined, &lt;em&gt;mean.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And gender is real.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because something&amp;#8217;s a social construction doesn&amp;#8217;t mean it&amp;#8217;s not real (despite many fellow &amp;#8220;social construction&amp;#8221; folks saying so).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Social Justice Fandom (AKA Creating New Barriers in the Name of Dismantling Others)</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/04/social-justice-fandom-aka-creating-new-barriers-name-dismantling-others/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2018 20:31:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/04/social-justice-fandom-aka-creating-new-barriers-name-dismantling-others/</guid><description>Maybe it was Glee. I don&amp;#8217;t know. But at some point, within a small subsection of a small subsection of the population, social justice became cool. And whenever something becomes cool, two things tend to follow.
The first is that some of the people who like the cool thing start to covet it, protect it from outsiders, and claim it as their own &amp;#8212; when just moments before those same people were making desperate pleas to others to like the thing they liked.</description></item><item><title>One Huge Prickly Reason Why Anti-LGBTQ Folks Don’t Change Their Views</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/01/ignored-reason-people-dont-affirm-lgbtq-people-make-harder/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2018 20:08:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/01/ignored-reason-people-dont-affirm-lgbtq-people-make-harder/</guid><description>I need you to take a leap with me.
Leap into the shoes of someone who has walked through their life knowing that being gay, being bi, lesbian, or pan, or that being non-binary, gender non-conforming, or trans — that being different, different from straight, different from cisgender — is wrong.</description></item><item><title>Let’s Talk About Bathrooms</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2017/03/lets-talk-about-bathrooms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2017 23:13:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2017/03/lets-talk-about-bathrooms/</guid><description>This is an excerpted NEW chapter from the 2nd Edition of my book, A Guide to Gender, which came out today (March 15th, 2017).

It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat Robertson famously said this in the 90s, and the sentiment still rings as true in the ears of many today.  It’s an understatement to say that &lt;a href=&#34;http://everydayfeminism.com/2012/07/feminist-myths/&#34; title=&#34;How Most Things You Know About Feminists Are Vicious Conservative Lies&#34;&gt;feminism has a bad rap.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feminism doesn’t hate men.&lt;/p&gt;

So many of us have experienced the frustration of being told something isn&amp;rsquo;t for us &amp;ndash; something we wanted to wear, or play with, or be &amp;ndash; because of our gender. It&amp;rsquo;s outrageous, and it&amp;rsquo;s something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be going away any time soon.</description></item><item><title>“Gay Marriage Equals” Poster</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/01/gay-marriage-equals-poster-print/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2012 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/01/gay-marriage-equals-poster-print/</guid><description>This poster is for Rick Santorum, et al. Same-sex marriages are happening, gays are serving openly in the military, and the world isn&amp;#8217;t falling apart (well, maybe it is, but it was a preexisting condition).

It&amp;#8217;s amazing how gendered toys are. If you see an action figure, you think boy. If you see a barbie, you think girl.

Wrong.
What we’ve been teaching our children, what I have learned and re-learned all of my life, is one of the worst pieces of advice around.
