I‚Äôm going to keep this short. I just put together an E-Book called ‚ÄúDefining LGBTQ+.‚Äù It‚Äôs a guide to gender and sexuality terminology, based on my article Comprehensive List of LGBTQ+ Vocabulary Definitions, which was based on the glossary from my first book (A Guide to Gender), that grew into a collaboration with Meg Bolger (The Safe Zone Project) and thousands of you.</description></item><item><title>What kind of ‚ÄúSocial Justice‚Äù are you talking about?</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/10/what-kind-of-social-justice-are-you-talking-about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2018 20:57:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/10/what-kind-of-social-justice-are-you-talking-about/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had lunch with a friend this week, and our conversation hit a peculiar roadblock: A lot of people are saying the same words ‚Äî ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù ‚Äî but meaning different things.

That's from the course description, and does a good job of summing this up.
