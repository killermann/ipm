That&amp;rsquo;s from the course description, and does a good job of summing this up.

A couple things to keep in mind up front:
Pronouns replace people’s names (e.g., “Sam is nice” ?</description></item><item><title>Social Justice Fandom (AKA Creating New Barriers in the Name of Dismantling Others)</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/04/social-justice-fandom-aka-creating-new-barriers-name-dismantling-others/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2018 20:31:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/04/social-justice-fandom-aka-creating-new-barriers-name-dismantling-others/</guid><description>Maybe it was Glee. I don&amp;#8217;t know. But at some point, within a small subsection of a small subsection of the population, social justice became cool. And whenever something becomes cool, two things tend to follow.
The first is that some of the people who like the cool thing start to covet it, protect it from outsiders, and claim it as their own &amp;#8212; when just moments before those same people were making desperate pleas to others to like the thing they liked.</description></item><item><title>Let’s Talk About Bathrooms</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2017/03/lets-talk-about-bathrooms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2017 23:13:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2017/03/lets-talk-about-bathrooms/</guid><description>This is an excerpted NEW chapter from the 2nd Edition of my book, A Guide to Gender, which came out today (March 15th, 2017).

In September 2016, I was asked to participate in Katie Couric&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Gender Revolution&amp;#8221; documentary (by National Geographic). The following questions were what I worked through &amp;#8212; and what I generally work through &amp;#8212; when deciding to say &amp;#8220;yes&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;no.</description></item><item><title>When Someone Comes Out To You: DO &amp; DON’T</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2016/04/when-someone-comes-out-to-you-do-dont/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 20:32:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2016/04/when-someone-comes-out-to-you-do-dont/</guid><description>In one of the first safe zone trainings I remember participating in, there was a loaded question about coming out that was followed by an excellent answer from the facilitator.
