It&amp;#8217;s become prevalent within the social justice movement, and I haven&amp;#8217;t seen anyone else flag it. I brought it up in the context of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sjmd.space&#34;&gt;Social Justice, Minus Dogma Course + Community&lt;/a&gt;, and it turns out other people are noticing it too. So let&amp;#8217;s flag it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short version is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people are using domination/oppression language (e.g., &amp;#8220;white supremacist&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;patriarchal&amp;#8221;) as synonyms for &amp;#8220;bad&amp;#8221; and marginalization/anti-oppression language (e.g., &amp;#8220;indigenous,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;decolonized,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;feminist&amp;#8221;) as synonyms for &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; devoid of any meaningful connection to the actual structure, system, or culture they&amp;#8217;re mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that it&amp;#8217;s a combination of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/isms-not-ists/&#34;&gt;over focusing on &amp;#8220;-ists&amp;#8221; instead of &amp;#8220;-isms&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; plus the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;social justice power inverse,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; but I&amp;#8217;ll leave the detective work up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why highlight this at all? In short, because actual, sincere, real-life White supremacy is on the rise, and we need to be able to call it when we see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling things &amp;#8220;White supremacist&amp;#8221; that aren&amp;#8217;t creates a lot of unhelpful noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this article a few days before we got a blazingly clear example of White supremacy in action, when &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1150381394234941448&#34;&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump went on a &amp;#8220;go back to your country&amp;#8221; rant&lt;/a&gt; against several members of congress, all of whom are women of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being careful to use the phrase &amp;#8220;White supremacy&amp;#8221; correctly would allow a criticism of Trump&amp;#8217;s rant, and other White supremacist actions, to be held as distinct from general criticisms of Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are totally valid, by the way! However, we need to know which basket we&amp;#8217;re putting our eggs into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be able to separate &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t like what you&amp;#8217;re saying&amp;#8221; from &amp;#8220;What you&amp;#8217;re saying is advancing White supremacy and ethnic cleansing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And right now we&amp;#8217;re not doing a good job of that, at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll explain what I&amp;#8217;m talking about in more detail, then talk about a few of the reasons &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; think this is (deeply) unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d be curious to hear what you think, if you&amp;#8217;re also noticing this. We&amp;#8217;ll make space for that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8220-white-supremacist-8221-doesn-8217-t-mean-a-8220-white-person-doing-something-bad-8221&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;White Supremacist&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t mean a &amp;#8220;White person doing something bad&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me first say that, overall, it&amp;#8217;s great that more people are becoming comfy using phrases like &amp;#8220;white supremacist.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for words like &amp;#8220;patriarchal,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;colonial,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;heterosexist,&amp;#8221; etc. They&amp;#8217;re useful words that can be used to pinpoint exactly what we&amp;#8217;re talking about, concerned about in society, and wanting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If we could just add &amp;#8220;capitalist&amp;#8221; to our comfort zone, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mediaed.org/transcripts/Bell-Hooks-Transcript.pdf&#34;&gt;we might even make bell hooks proud&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue I&amp;#8217;m flagging here is&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the use of the phrase &amp;#8220;white supremacist&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; (or any of these other words I&amp;#8217;m lumping together as domination/oppression language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue is people using these words like duct tape, sticking them to every problem they notice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what it looks like in general:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Social Justice Minus Dogma Online Course</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/courses/social-justice-minus-dogma-course/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2019 17:34:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/courses/social-justice-minus-dogma-course/</guid><description>Over the course of 6 weeks of self-guided learning (or however long you choose), explore the social justice dogma, identify its cornerstones and pitfalls, and plot a path forward toward true living social justice.

Equitable. Utopian, even. Whatever comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give it a shot. I’ll wait a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it feel like to occupy that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/&#34;&gt;future world&lt;/a&gt; where all of our work as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/&#34;&gt;social justice people&lt;/a&gt; came to fruition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does it differ from our world today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How radical of a difference you notice will be determined by the world you have in your mind. But surely the ways we spend our time, the social problems we grapple with, and even the ways we organize societies aren&amp;#8217;t the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do “jobs” look like? Do they even still exist? What about politics? What will there be more of? What will there be less of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s likely a long list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/introducing-the-social-justice-compass/&#34;&gt;actions, attitudes, and beliefs&lt;/a&gt; that wouldn’t make sense in that world, but seem perfectly sensical in our world right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes to mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the gap, the distance between what would be normal in a socially-just world, compared to what is normal now in our oppressive and unjust world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now here comes the really tough part:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>-isms, not -ists</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/isms-not-ists/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 16:11:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/04/isms-not-ists/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To achieve the goals of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/socialjustice/&#34;&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt;, we need to reform society at the system level. We need to dismantle rac&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, sex&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, cissex&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, heterosex&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, gender&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, able&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, class&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much of social justice discourse and calls-to-action are focused on the &lt;em&gt;-ists&lt;/em&gt;, the people participating in (and perpetuating) those systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our focus on individual actors keeps increasing in social justice spaces&lt;/strong&gt; I occupy. It’s almost all of what I notice in online social justice activism/advocacy. I’m guessing you’ve noticed it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This focus often takes the form of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/10/what-kind-of-social-justice-are-you-talking-about/&#34;&gt;punitive social justice&lt;/a&gt;, identifying perpetrators, dragging them, publicly shaming them, “canceling” them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Replacing One Binary with Another</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2019 16:43:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/binary-thinking/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always believed that one of our superpowers as gender/sexuality activists, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/&#34;&gt;social justice people&lt;/a&gt; more broadly, is our ability to hold space for nuance. In the past few years, that belief has been crumbling. In part because of how much I&amp;#8217;m seeing us replace one way of binary thinking for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, we&amp;#8217;ve known that sexuality isn&amp;#8217;t a binary thing. It&amp;#8217;s not gay/straight, either/or. It&amp;#8217;s often both/and, neither, or another option altogether. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale&#34;&gt;The Kinsey Scale&lt;/a&gt; often comes to mind here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, we&amp;#8217;ve recognized the same thing about gender. We&amp;#8217;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRcPXtqdKjE&#34;&gt;addressed the complexities of gender&lt;/a&gt;, viewing it on a spectrum, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/02/gender-scales-or-spectrums/&#34;&gt;or, better, on scales&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/11/breaking-through-the-binary-gender-explained-using-continuums/&#34;&gt;broken through the binary&lt;/a&gt; of woman/man. Just like sexuality, it&amp;#8217;s not an either/or, but more of a both/and, neither, or another option altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;#8217;s not entirely clear to me that everyone writing about binaries (e.g., the gender binary) is saying the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So allow me to be clear what I mean (and have always meant) by binary: two options. Two ways to be. Two categories. And that&amp;#8217;s it. Only two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A binary can be succinctly summed up by this (no words needed):&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Social Justice Power Inverse</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 18:19:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of social justice conversations focus on power. Who has power in society and who doesn&amp;#8217;t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We highlight how systems inequitably distribute power to some while withholding it from others &amp;#8212; based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/individual-difference-and-group-similiarity/&#34;&gt;who we are&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We refer to people who are granted disproportionate power as &amp;#8220;privileged,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;majoritized,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;centered,&amp;#8221; etc. And those from whom power is withheld as &amp;#8220;oppressed,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;minoritized,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;marginalized,&amp;#8221; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, nobody is only one of those two. We&amp;#8217;re both, depending on which situation we&amp;#8217;re in, and what dimensions of ourselves are brought to the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal in talking about this is dismantling inequitable power structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/introducing-the-social-justice-compass/&#34;&gt;The needle on our compass points toward equity.&lt;/a&gt; Removing barriers, promoting access, and shrinking the gap between the &amp;#8220;haves&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;have nots&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; or, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/&#34;&gt;a perfect world&lt;/a&gt;, making that dichotomy irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we don&amp;#8217;t talk about is how power structures manifest in social justice spaces, or the micro-society that is the community of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/&#34;&gt;social justice people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we preserve the idea of the power structure, but swap out who sits where.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Two Worlds Dilemma</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2019 18:37:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Every justice movement &amp;#8212; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/gender-2/&#34;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/sexuality&#34;&gt;sexuality&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/individual-difference-and-group-similiarity/&#34;&gt;every other dimension&lt;/a&gt; of who we are and how the world sees us &amp;#8212; has to answer two big questions: What&amp;#8217;s wrong with the world now? And what future world do you want to create?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m the fly on the wall for thousands of conversations about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/category/socialjustice/&#34;&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avast!&lt;/em&gt; A new model for thinking about and doing social justice&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;ho&lt;/em&gt;! This is off to a bad start. It turns out that every day can be &lt;a href=&#34;http://talklikeapirate.com/wordpress/&#34;&gt;International Talk like a Pirate Day&lt;/a&gt; if you don&amp;#8217;t care about having friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>If You’re Still Doing Social Justice How You Were Then, Reconsider.</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/social-justice-then-and-now/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 19:41:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/social-justice-then-and-now/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve seen people at conferences giving the same talk they gave two years ago. Activists speaking and organizing in ways unchanged since 2015. Educators facilitating workshops with a curriculum written in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is different now than it was then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people you&amp;#8217;re working with &amp;#8212; or against, or for &amp;#8212; have different mindsets, beliefs, knowledge, perspectives, values, opinions, grudges, predispositions, awarenesses, and biases now than they did then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world you&amp;#8217;re working in &amp;#8212; and trying to improve &amp;#8212; is comprised of different technologies, constituencies, zeitgeists, cultural norms, and public knowledge now than it was then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;#8220;then&amp;#8221; could be yesterday. Or last year. Your &amp;#8220;then&amp;#8221; could be &amp;#8220;before Trump was elected. Or &amp;#8220;when we didn&amp;#8217;t know this huge thing.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;before &amp;#8216;Black Lives Matter&amp;#8217; activism started.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;when we weren&amp;#8217;t sure whether this one thing would work or not.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;before our community experienced that travesty.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;when we didn&amp;#8217;t have social media.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started doing social justice work, most people didn&amp;#8217;t know what &amp;#8220;social justice&amp;#8221; meant. They&amp;#8217;d never heard the phrase. It was brand new to them. That was the first bar to jump: explaining &lt;em&gt;what I was working to do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;then&amp;#8221;: when most people I encountered hadn&amp;#8217;t heard the phrase &amp;#8220;social justice.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What Hypocrisy Theatre Is, and Why It Doesn’t Work</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/hypocrisy-theatre/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 18:25:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/hypocrisy-theatre/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say a friend of yours made a New Year&amp;#8217;s resolution to stop being on their phone during dinner. It&amp;#8217;s January 4th, you&amp;#8217;re sharing a table, and you catch them peeping their insta. You call them on it, they apologize, and put their phone away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypocrisy, meet behavior. Behavior, meet change. &lt;em&gt;Huzzah!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s how calling someone out on their hypocrisy &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;. There are a few important factors here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person you&amp;#8217;re calling out has stated (or otherwise believes) that they want to walk a particular (moral) path: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;From&amp;nbsp;now&amp;nbsp;on,&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;going&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;do X.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You notice their actions are contrary to that, and actively getting in the way of them living that espoused value, or walking their talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You point out this gap: &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;You said you were going to do X, but now you&amp;#8217;re doing Anti-X.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This prompts &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-cognitive-dissonance-2795012&#34;&gt;cognitive dissonance&lt;/a&gt;, and they have to pick a path: do as they said they&amp;#8217;d do, or give up on that moral stance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each one of those four steps is necessary. They work as a chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;welcome-to-hypocrisy-theatre-where-social-media-is-our-stage-and-our-audience-is-only-people-who-already-agree-with-us&#34;&gt;Welcome to Hypocrisy Theatre: Where Social Media is Our Stage and Our Audience is Only People Who Already Agree With Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years now, there&amp;#8217;s been a new show in town: Hypocrisy Theatre. And unlike the example above, Hypocrisy Theatre isn&amp;#8217;t effective in changing the hypocrite&amp;#8217;s behavior. Indeed, they&amp;#8217;re not even part of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#8217;ve caught a performance of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cast changes daily, but the show always follows the same script: some random person on social media points out that some other random person they disagree with once said something that flies in the face of a thing they&amp;#8217;re saying now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; every case, when I&amp;#8217;d start a conversation about Social Justice Dogma (SJD), the person I was talking with recognized the phenomenon, without me needing to explain what I meant &amp;#8212;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;even if they&amp;#8217;d never heard the phrase &amp;#8220;social justice dogma.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;d reply with something like, &amp;#8220;Oh, I know what you&amp;#8217;re talking about,&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Oh yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a big thing in my circle.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we&amp;#8217;d get into some particular tenet that they were struggling with. Or talk through a recent current event, using the dogma as the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the conversations generally ended the same, with them saying something like &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m happy you&amp;#8217;re talking about this&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;This conversation is needed&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to seeing more on this.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the conversation ended.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What kind of “Social Justice” are you talking about?</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/10/what-kind-of-social-justice-are-you-talking-about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2018 20:57:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/10/what-kind-of-social-justice-are-you-talking-about/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I had lunch with a friend this week, and our conversation hit a peculiar roadblock: A lot of people are saying the same words &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;social justice&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; but meaning different things. This is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you say &amp;#8220;social justice,&amp;#8221; what kind of justice are you talking about?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yes, gender is a social construction. No, that doesn’t mean it’s not real.</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/09/yes-gender-is-a-social-construction-no-that-doesnt-mean-its-not-real/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2018 21:26:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/09/yes-gender-is-a-social-construction-no-that-doesnt-mean-its-not-real/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Gender is a social construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you take the most extreme &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/biology-general/biological-determinism&#34;&gt;biological determinist&lt;/a&gt; stance (which a lot of the &amp;#8220;gender isn&amp;#8217;t a social construction&amp;#8221; crowd take), you cannot deny the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What it means to be a &amp;#8220;woman&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;man&amp;#8221; changes over time (often within the timeframe of a generation &amp;#8212; ask your grandparents if you don&amp;#8217;t believe me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further, right now, the traits associated with each of those roles are different in different parts of the world (watch a sitcom from another country if you don&amp;#8217;t believe me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our understanding of gender changes faster than our biology could possibly evolve, and currently exists in many forms around the world reflecting cultural differences, it&amp;#8217;s socially constructed. End of argument. That&amp;#8217;s what those two words, combined, &lt;em&gt;mean.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And gender is real.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because something&amp;#8217;s a social construction doesn&amp;#8217;t mean it&amp;#8217;s not real (despite many fellow &amp;#8220;social construction&amp;#8221; folks saying so).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>3 Tenets of Social Justice Dogma that are Getting in Our Way</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/06/unhelpful-tenets-social-justice-dogma/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 17:46:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/06/unhelpful-tenets-social-justice-dogma/</guid><description>Now that I&amp;#8217;ve been talking openly about Social Justice Dogma (SJD) for a few months, I have some findings I want to share.

The first is that some of the people who like the cool thing start to covet it, protect it from outsiders, and claim it as their own &amp;#8212; when just moments before those same people were making desperate pleas to others to like the thing they liked.</description></item><item><title>Some Different Taxonomies for Social Justice People</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Mar 2018 22:29:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/</guid><description>We often group social justice people by identity, cause, or &amp;#8220;-ism&amp;#8221; (e.g., racial justice people, gender justice, queer justice, wage justice).

It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat Robertson famously said this in the 90s, and the sentiment still rings as true in the ears of many today.  It’s an understatement to say that &lt;a href=&#34;http://everydayfeminism.com/2012/07/feminist-myths/&#34; title=&#34;How Most Things You Know About Feminists Are Vicious Conservative Lies&#34;&gt;feminism has a bad rap.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve social justice we will have to break down a lot of huge barriers that exist on a scale far above the individual, but even the biggest scale change is nothing more than the sum of &lt;em&gt;a whole lot&lt;/em&gt; of individual efforts.  My goal with this site is to support you in doing just that: making big change on an individual level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following are _a whole_ &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of individual efforts you can make today that will be significant steps toward that biggest scale change we need for a socially just tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Top Ten Tips on how to Thicken your Skin</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/09/tips-on-thickening-skin-in-social-justice-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 21:23:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/09/tips-on-thickening-skin-in-social-justice-work/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I received the following email from a high school senior (we&amp;#8217;ll call her Angie), replied to her, she appreciated the response and told me she&amp;#8217;d be cool with me sharing it with you folks in case any one else might be able to find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need tips on how to thicken my skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s my issue. I&amp;#8217;m taking Gender/Sexuality Diversity in Literature (basically Gender Studies), and there are kids in my class who don&amp;#8217;t believe in bisexuality, let alone *my* sexuality (aka. pansexuality). I&amp;#8217;m an easy crier and I just know that when this rather basic problem surfaces&amp;#8211;because I&amp;#8217;ve only ever heard these kids mutter their opinions under their breath&amp;#8211;I won&amp;#8217;t make it through the conversation. So, tips?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve thought about coming out to the class (I&amp;#8217;m out to my friends, family, most teachers, and Facebook, but most people don&amp;#8217;t know) but haven&amp;#8217;t. I want people to step on eggshells because they&amp;#8217;re being inclusive, not because I&amp;#8217;m in the room and they don&amp;#8217;t want to offend me personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts? Totally fine if not. A snarky one-liner would be just as welcome, because you&amp;#8217;re hilarious and shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you walk through your life, you&amp;#8217;re surrounded by the accomplishments and influences of individuals of the past and present.  You&amp;#8217;re surrounded by a world &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; built &amp;#8212; for you, and everyone around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, for one, am not entirely happy with the world that has been built for me.  I want to live in a world that is socially just, where individuals all have the same access to the good stuff &amp;#8212; education, jobs, swedish fish, etc. &amp;#8212; regardless of the identities they do or do not possess.  If you&amp;#8217;re like me, you&amp;#8217;ve likely thought, at some point, something along the lines of &lt;em&gt;I want to make this world a better place to live in&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to respond when someone uses non-inclusive (or bigoted) language</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/06/how-to-respond-to-non-inclusive-language-or-bigoted-speec/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jun 2012 21:24:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/06/how-to-respond-to-non-inclusive-language-or-bigoted-speec/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Why your intentions don’t really matter, but outcomes do&#34; href=&#34;https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/04/why-your-intentions-dont-matter-victim-blaming-and-political-correctness/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Intentions don&amp;#8217;t matter, outcomes do&lt;/a&gt;.  However, I still think we need to do a much better job of being supportive of newcomers to the social justice &amp;#8220;scene&amp;#8221; who may be well-intended, but don&amp;#8217;t quite know the ropes yet.  &lt;/p&gt;
