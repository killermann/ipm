&lt;p>Bisexuality is a thing. It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúa stop between gay and straight.‚Äù But how do you explain that to someone who just. simply. won‚Äôt. believe. you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to focus on the struggle many bisexual and pansexual folks have convincing their straight (or gay/lesbian) peers that bisexuality¬†is an identity, not just a stopping point between two others. ¬†While I‚Äôm focusing this article on advice for bi- and pansexual folks, some of it applies to all sexuality discussions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I need tips on how to thicken my skin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here‚Äôs my issue. I‚Äôm taking Gender/Sexuality Diversity in Literature (basically Gender Studies), and there are kids in my class who don‚Äôt believe in bisexuality, let alone *my* sexuality (aka. pansexuality). I‚Äôm an easy crier and I just know that when this rather basic problem surfaces‚Äìbecause I‚Äôve only ever heard these kids mutter their opinions under their breath‚ÄìI won‚Äôt make it through the conversation. So, tips?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I‚Äôve thought about coming out to the class (I‚Äôm out to my friends, family, most teachers, and Facebook, but most people don‚Äôt know) but haven‚Äôt. I want people to step on eggshells because they‚Äôre being inclusive, not because I‚Äôm in the room and they don‚Äôt want to offend me personally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any thoughts? Totally fine if not. A snarky one-liner would be just as welcome, because you‚Äôre hilarious and shit.&lt;/p>
