Who has power in society and who doesn‚Äôt?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We highlight how systems inequitably distribute power to some while withholding it from others ‚Äî based on &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/10/individual-difference-and-group-similiarity/">who we are&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We refer to people who are granted disproportionate power as ‚Äúprivileged,‚Äù ‚Äúmajoritized,‚Äù ‚Äúcentered,‚Äù etc. And those from whom power is withheld as ‚Äúoppressed,‚Äù ‚Äúminoritized,‚Äù ‚Äúmarginalized,‚Äù etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, nobody is only one of those two. We‚Äôre both, depending on which situation we‚Äôre in, and what dimensions of ourselves are brought to the forefront.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our goal in talking about this is dismantling inequitable power structures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/01/introducing-the-social-justice-compass/">The needle on our compass points toward equity.&lt;/a> Removing barriers, promoting access, and shrinking the gap between the ‚Äúhaves‚Äù and ‚Äúhave nots‚Äù ‚Äî or, in &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/">a perfect world&lt;/a>, making that dichotomy irrelevant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the things we don‚Äôt talk about is how power structures manifest in social justice spaces, or the micro-society that is the community of &lt;a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/">social justice people&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, we preserve the idea of the power structure, but swap out who sits where.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Defining LGBTQ+</title><link>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/books/defining-lgbtq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2019 00:21:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/books/defining-lgbtq/</guid><description>Defining LBGTQ+ is a helpful guide for getting a grasp on the terminology of gender and sexuality.
