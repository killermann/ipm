Who has power in society and who doesn&amp;#8217;t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We highlight how systems inequitably distribute power to some while withholding it from others &amp;#8212; based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/10/individual-difference-and-group-similiarity/&#34;&gt;who we are&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We refer to people who are granted disproportionate power as &amp;#8220;privileged,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;majoritized,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;centered,&amp;#8221; etc. And those from whom power is withheld as &amp;#8220;oppressed,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;minoritized,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;marginalized,&amp;#8221; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, nobody is only one of those two. We&amp;#8217;re both, depending on which situation we&amp;#8217;re in, and what dimensions of ourselves are brought to the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal in talking about this is dismantling inequitable power structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/01/introducing-the-social-justice-compass/&#34;&gt;The needle on our compass points toward equity.&lt;/a&gt; Removing barriers, promoting access, and shrinking the gap between the &amp;#8220;haves&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;have nots&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; or, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2019/03/the-two-worlds-dilemma/&#34;&gt;a perfect world&lt;/a&gt;, making that dichotomy irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we don&amp;#8217;t talk about is how power structures manifest in social justice spaces, or the micro-society that is the community of &lt;a href=&#34;https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2018/03/taxonomy-social-justice-people/&#34;&gt;social justice people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we preserve the idea of the power structure, but swap out who sits where.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Defining LGBTQ&#43;</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/books/defining-lgbtq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2019 00:21:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/books/defining-lgbtq/</guid><description>Defining LBGTQ+ is a helpful guide for getting a grasp on the terminology of gender and sexuality.

&lt;p&gt;I find myself saying &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;re not the same, but we&amp;#8217;re also not that different,&amp;#8221; to the furrowing of brows, so I wanted to take a moment here to talk about the relationship of individual identity and social group memberships, as well as introduce a new graphic concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What does the asterisk in “trans*” stand for?</title><link>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/05/what-does-the-asterisk-in-trans-stand-for/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2012 20:01:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.netlify.com/2012/05/what-does-the-asterisk-in-trans-stand-for/</guid><description>A few people have asked why I write &amp;#8220;trans*&amp;#8221; (with the asterisk) instead of just &amp;#8220;trans&amp;#8221; when referring to trans* folks on my site.
